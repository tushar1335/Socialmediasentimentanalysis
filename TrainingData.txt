SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Akica akica;one of the best reviewer on yt
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Gaurang Wanere;do give a comparison of battery life with respect to s8 and is it really worth its value
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jason Thiner;weather you like it or hate samsung is going to sell millions of theses phones only apple and samsung can sell a phone over thousand buck and out sell the competition when the rest of the competition is trying is trying to get the under 500ish market and cant sell a single phone fell bad for the rest of the phone manufacturer who make a decent device for all most half the price of this phone and the sad thing is most people would be completely fine with a lg htc one plus nokia motorola  phone  but it all has to do with that name that is on this phone

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;max van dijk;the ass pen is meh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TwstedTV;load the phone with apps and games to 99 and watch the phone come to a crawling halt like most phones do see most people dont test this there are many many many hardcore users out there and they tend to pack their phones with lots of softwares and games and when that happens over time as you use the phone while its packed with softwares and games the phone starts to get sluggish and the hiccups begin just some thoughts of real life usage  ive been through this thousands of times already so i speak from experience remember most people live on their phones so they tend to pack it with many things hindering its performance for some odd reason its my belief that manufacturers use the space on the internal storage as some sort of buffer for its phones instead of using its ram for that sorta like virtual memory on a regular computer assigning drive space for virtual ram sorta thing
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TwstedTV;the question is how is samsung knowing how long people use their phone do they have some sort of call home software embedded within the phone im very curious to how they know how long people are using the new phone vs the previous phone hmmm food for thoughts

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tom Bosch;hi im doubting to preorder the note 8 because of the battery capacity im using my phone for business all the time as in every meeting every business day next to that the streaming video anf normal app usage so 24h 1 charge should be minimal the weightwondering how the balance will be and if it feels bulky or not thanks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rav Ravenous;how in the hell do you find the 126gb version over the 64gb
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JSPR shots;why does everyone hate bixby it is useful for navigating your phone also the fingerprint scanner placement is not bad i never had any troubles finding it and i never placed my finger on the camera you guys are just nitpicky
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tek Ghimire;amazing device but not for us only for rich persons thank you
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;lifestylesdefined;i agree with you on that battery i can deal with the s pen ill never use the dual camera that will be useless the marginal increase on the display from my s8 but that battery i cant deal with that dope video as always homie
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mani Manideep;can you explain a video of camera each settings and features of spen in detail
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ainek Gonz√°lez;they should really take off de bixby botton
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Luthfi Aldi;finally still loyal to s7 edge
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JustinianXLIII;i love this review its real i also am worried about the battery life being horrid like the note 7 i currently run the note 5 and its stamina is great but thats because its os isnt that packed with features and it has an exynos chip this note 8 will have snapdragon in the us bixby will certainly run in the background and eat the battery very worried for that battery life also i really dont need bixby
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mr. Akki The Targeted.;with all the advancements in cell phones over the decades still you basically have to charge your phone every night thats insane to me still getting the 8 tho
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Luv Patel;i will love to see the full reviewüòä
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tony Johansson;i really wish they went back to humongous batterycapacity they had on the earlier versions when you could take the note on a three day roadtrip or at least have a replacable battery drop the bixby and sort the sluggishness and you have a perfect phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;madan pal;ive had samsung laptop which i bought for 1100 dollars it was a design nightmare the hinges came off quickly and the screen went into repair for 3 times and the fourth time screen went into repair i just gave up on the laptop the fourth time was after the warranty so i had developed this cynical view on samsung and its products  but maybe i am wrong maybe samsung makes shitty laptops but samsung phones are top notch notwithstanding the horrible touchwiz i would love to buy a note 8 over iphone anyday its absolutely the most gorgeous phone i have ever seen and yes the early renditions of iphone 8 are worse looking than note 8 note 8 is the phone of the year if it doesnt blow up anymore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Anonymus;boom
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;purpysmart;got the s8 plus now ill wait for the s9 maybe we can get fingerprint sensor on front on glassand hoping for a stereo speaker that would be a perfect phone for me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dylan vanzutphen-kann;had the v20 and wide angle was gimmick af definitely happy with decision of 2x optical zoom also v20 selfie mode always produced washed out plastic photos
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jojo Sitompul;i actually dont use the spen of my tab a
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Infinit3Enigma;i really want it because of the spen that serrogate mouse will really help for running linux payload on the phone or any small touch objects though i too want to know about the slowdowns or if selinux is intrusive like it is on nougat on the s7s8 wasnt a problem on marshmellow
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andre Cabezas;good review as always the battery is the 1st problem especially for the price you pay you may need an extra battery i keep my keyone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Christopher Ikechukwu Eyidah;having handled a s8 and s8 plus i know the fingerprint scanner is not hard to reach and i dont have large hands
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;El Barto;basically s8¬≤
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;hulkpayne;the thing about samsung that makes it inferior to apple is product support timesamsung wants you to forget about the note 4 or the galaxy s5 that you bought years ago while apple still supports their 5s with all its might also samsung will never be as good as apple in phones because the software and hardware marriage in iphones is unbeatablefor instance the newly released android oreo will take months to be available for the galaxy s8 thats a proper shame in 2017 dearit is because of iphones efficient hardware and software marriage that made the galaxy s8 from 2017 loose against the iphone 7 from last year in performance and ram management tests
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Earl Lacefield;important question does this finally have stereo speakers i cant stand the single bottom speaker now that ive been spoiled by the stereo speakers of the iphone 7 plus i really hope samsung finally made this jump
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;HDose;for 1000 price tag samsung better provide support in 5 years
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jp Highbaugh;god i hate all these flag ship phones skimping on the battery we all dont work at desk all day long i cant plug my phone in until 8 12hours later after work i had the note 5 and it was dying after lunch and with a mophie case i would still have to plug my phone in on the drive home that reason alone is prob i wont be buying the note 8 and im going to wait and see what apple has to offer
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Fahad Jawed;note 8 is da bomb     oh wait

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;WizardofTacoma;i am a samsung galaxy note 4 user there are many significant changes over my note 4 the note line of phones have been know to be the largest phones note users keep asking samsung for larger phones i use the note 4 with a carrying case on a lanyard around my neck my dissappointment is that its not more tablet size like the samsung galaxy tab s3 for the visually impaired a larger phones is what we seek in this case bigger is better maybe note 9 or 10 will be more tablet size
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;george gitau;for a 63 inch qhd screen that battery is a deal breaker

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Private Idaho;the fingerprint scanner belongs on the front of the phone  the people who swim in circles training to explain to the rest of us dummies that its ok on the back are from the phone makers marketing department

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;noam27v;is that a brick or a smartphone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sahaj Grewal;does the s pen get stuck backwards like the note 5
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Joe Fitness Academy;i wasnt impressed at all  i felt like they went all out at the s8  s8 plus event and they did the note 8 event just because they had to just because the iphone 8s event is right around the corner   especially with that 900 plus price tag for the phone  you can actually pay half of that for a refurbished note 7 model from korea with basically similar specs and a similar ui  pay an extra 400 to 500 for a note 8 is literally ridiculous  i dont care how loyal you can be to samsung dishing out that much money for a phone is just plain stupid  the oneplus 5 is looking pretty damn good right about now
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;greenranger2482;how about the front facing camera is it at 8 or a 5 megapixel
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;choo Tech guy;let people buy first because i scared that they will explode
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sinbad WhiteLine;the only reason i waited for the note is for the promised vr features that supposedly excel the s8 and s8 i hope you can give us a review on that

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jack Xie;cheap for a bomb expensive for a phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Austin Rice;i hate the back camera you can have dual cameras without looking hideous hauwie managed to make it look pretty normal so it shocks me that samsung and apple fucked their designs up when they couldve easily made it flush with the phone and less bulbous the honor 8 and 9 have great cameras and look gorgeous at the same time so does the p10 and thats what i expect from samsung especially for 1000 its still a good phone and im sure the camera will be killer but i hope to see it better implemented for the 9 that display has me swooning tho lets see how the v30 and mate 11 stack up againts it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Josh Bacon;lets hope this one wont turn into a bomb
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rebel321;note 7 was very good looking phone i dont like this note 8 not impressed me looks ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Omar Axel Rodriguez Martinez;finally someone share my opinion about the 2nd camara i prefer the wide angle like lg style  im not saying is better or the iphone style is bad just give to the people options i hope the new pixel has this super wide angle

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Thomas Brown;your video sacked the phone itself is brilliant but your video sucks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TrippleZ3D;from my opinion and my taste the phone is very good looking from the front as from the backwhy is the back ugly to others i dont knowto me it looks like a heavy equiped devicewhere else to put dual cameras and heart rate sensor than on the backprobably the finger print sensor should be lower or anywhere but not near the camerasbut heyif you dont like the backuse some d brand skinsthey realy are the best and your special phone will get more specialtrust mefrom my experience when friends saw the skin on my phone we talked more about the skin than of the phone

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;shaolin95;samsung used to be so good and then they messed up the note and now we have this stupid aspect ratio which is beyond stupid on all their phones lame
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Brian Johnson;this is the greatestits great but video powerful device but the battery capacity the camera is impressive but it would be better to have the extra wide angle lens sounds like samsung all great on the surface but a little shallow once you dig a little deeper

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Blake Jordan;samsung copied apple once again with its camera when will it stop
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Chi Wong;i think samsung play it to save on the note 8 they should try to bring something more innovative because it look to similar to the s8 i think it  loose lots of sales to iphone8 when its release i wouldnt be getting the note 8 i will stick with my s8

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Janette Bishop-Quiroz;dex dock pricing
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ali Mirza;i guess some devices with android 70 had some microstuttering in their ui so with newer android 711 is the galaxy note 8 smoother than the android 70 galaxy s8 i heard that android oreo 80 improves touch latency specially for lock screen lag the only hype i get is from lg lg v30 all the way just shift to lg from other brands and you will not regret a bit lg is best

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vinod Rajput;not revolutionary only dual ois cameras  spen its not going to kill iphone 8 dear samsung we saying u a king of android and u disappointed us lack of 3d sensing camera under the display fingerprint scanner 3d touch display powerful processor than coming a11 and newly version of very samsungs customer ui which will more powerful than ios 11 samsung really disappointing us

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Paritosh Purohit;the cameras somehow look like a pair of eyes glancing at you
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Danny Jelenic;is this worth the upgrade from my s8 plus
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shubh Bhushan;apple right now are you kidding me and google right now  the dawn of android
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aman Saini;and they said its gonna be iphone 8 killer puffhh bullsit
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TessellatedGuy;perfect phone for me except the size s8 it is then
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eshan Tripathi;its an amazing phonei want to get hands on unfortunately im not that much rich hard luck fo me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mAndro Hz;action memo is missing can you write a number on a samsung note and make a call or add to contacts amazing that they removed this feature on note 7 is it still gone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cristian International Trade;at last i am going to upgrade my loyal note 4 3 years with it i have never had any problem about note 4 i will buy this note 8 in october or november to check other buyers experience first
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Lalit Singh Fauzdar;i am getting a feeling that jerry will rig everything from this phone as its beauty seems weaker
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ShadowSlayer;i like that theres a wide angle and telephoto lens instead of one or the other
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vedant Goel;a 1000 i mean i wasnt gonna buy it cause its too expensive anyways but a fckin 1000 dollars aint that way too much
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vishnu Dev;mrmobie  why dont you review nokia 8 and went for samsung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eric Sellado;does the front camera have oiseis so that you can use it for vlogging while walking tnx mr mobile
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ron cosby;could you imagine how great this would be with a wide angle secondary lense with ois pity i wont be buying it hello v30
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ashlee R;i was holding out for this phone  but i am let down by the design maybe when i watch your full review it will change my mind but for right now i am not sold
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matthew Joshua Sosito;please can you make a review on the galaxy j7 pro and does it stuck up with the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jonathan Engelbart;they literally could have put the whole camerafingerprint cut out vertically instead of horizontally  why samsung why
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Wonginism;why would you like a wide angle just shove a filter on it i hit the fingerprint sensor on to the s8 first time without an issue functionally no problem  what is a big problem is laptops like the yoga it is a way greater sin to have useless squishy buttons on the back of a tablet or device one other stupid comment is the surface book screen gap i think the gap is much preferable than keyboard imprints on your screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;DeltaTeam771;for your full review would it somehow be possible to reuse or call back to some of the things you said about the note 4 from your pocketnow video things like the stylus or how the note 4 had a 2k display or the battery size back in the day that would be awesome
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;stevestojan;if the gate agent andor flight attendant cant see a physical difference why bother
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;James Bond;his complaints about the fps and battery are unjustified being a phone guru he should know the more efficient 835 cpu combined with the newest version of android equate to better battery life the phone should perform better than s8 despite it having 200mah less battery capacity  as far as the fps placement is concerned why are you still using this when you have iris scanning which is more secure and more reliable than an fps
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andi Annas;just me being simple i saw mrmobiles note8s video i clicked  butbut there were many other videos about note8 before mrmobiles  yeah not worth it not as good as his videos d
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Godz29;i got no use of my bixby for my s8 i find it kinda annoying
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Patrick King;im still waiting for the removable batteries to be brought back  every note phone i ever owned i had to switch the batteries at least once per day sometimes twice a day  its at the point that phones with built in batteries are useless to me anymore  and why the hell arent consumers complaining about removable batteries so much anymore  you people give up so easily
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Roshan Kumar Dixit;battery reduced as they are still skeptical
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MR. T;a less attractive s8 with a weaker battery and a pen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Marcos Reves;its obvious the fingerprint reader is in a bad location but is it worse than the s8 given that the note 8 is taller id think so but not really sure
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Johnny Questt;thanks 4a sidebyside comparison with the 8 excellent preface 2a full review indeed

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;akash zinta;you are rightbattery capacity is the most important featurewhat good all other features gonna do if you cant even use your phone for more than 67 hrs
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt Dargis;the back of that phone is ugly as sin looks like a microwave if that makes any sense
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aakash Cheema;520 its iris scanning and not retina scanning
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cumi lu;agree with you michaelseems samsung still think they only competes with apple and turns out to be apple like perhaps samsung need to try to redefined themselfbe a trend setter
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;realista182;ahaha fingerprint in that odd position no thanksnot even if you sell it at 300usdi would never buy a phone with fingerprint sensor in thatoddposition

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Bradley Valdivia;im stuck inbetween the note 8 and the s8 i have kept my note 5 waiting for the note 8 and im  wondering if the cost of the note 8 is worth it im not sure if i use the s pen enough and if i need everything else for the price difference can anyone give me some ideas to help me choose
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;hrishabh singh football;can that dual camera and s pen justify such elevation in the price tag smh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;master chief;does the note 8 have edge lighting

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;GuuzakaTube;love the increased screen estate but not a fan of the bixby button and fingerprint scanner location ü§î
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sting0072007;why would you give your fingerprint retina scan face scan to a company
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Simona Hall;can you still create gif like you did on note 7
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zyehn Sych;i want to know how the galaxy note 8 taste
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dumb Bell;another bullshit phone from samsung that will run good for a year and crap out after that‚Äôs why i always stick to google releases for personal use and iphone for my work phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Harshal Kale;fuk u techrax plz dont destroy it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ruzinon Silva;apple will have to make a cell phone that flies
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;VacancyJB;i think phone industry is kinda up to the bottle neck no much special to see new phones coming our bigger screen better specs better cameranothing else
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Chow;without a doubt its another great phone yet but the price tag seems holding me back from investing in this handset
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D13H4RD2L1V3;kinda want one to fill the void left by my note 7  but eh i already got a laptop just recently that blew the budget and my current phone works fine  cool that note 7 owners get a rebate if they choose to trade in whatever phone they have dont know how theyd do that though
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kishore tvk;why buy note 8 im currently using note 5 phone might be great but battery is a very big concern
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pink Wards;can i get 20 likes for nothing
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jeremy Wilder;do you do comparison videos anymore usually when im considering a phone i am trying to decide between two models the pixel 2 when its avaiable vs the note 8 for instance
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JOE Bozza;nice phonebut has one major problemits not an iphone üì±
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;VacancyJB;you are wrong bixby is very powerful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;fantastic life;like s8 plus exept the pen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Lee Busch;michael you asked for questionsconcerns to examine in your longterm review my topofmind concerns 1 comparecontrast the value of proprietary software vs delayed updates 2 is it bloatware or great features  discuss 3 total cost of ownership of this vs other androids and iphones not just purchase price but resale value and depreciation for those who change phones every 13 years 4 and in general i question why spend more on a phone than on a laptop thanks for all you do
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Bonedatt;yay note 4 gets an honorary mention still rocking mine disappointed with this release though maybe the note9 will have something tangible  refined design like symmetrical bottom ports a better fingerprint sensor placement return of the ir blaster bigger battery regardless of how efficient qualcomms chip gets etc to warrant an upgrade i just wish another oem would be bold enough to challenge samsung by creating stylus software that works just as good or better than the spens this is the main reason i stick with the note series the spen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Gabrael St hilaire;thanks for this great sub review mr michaelfisher
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;diego l√≥pez;i own a g6 and i reallly hope to samsung to went with a wide angle camera this hits me hard because i miss the spen funtionatily from my note 5 from years ago but i know that i would miss the wide angle camera if i made the change
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zack Halverson;im just waiting for the quad camera wide telephoto blackwhite and a normal color one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Whitaker;waiting on the lg v30 then ill decide leaning towards the v30 though even though i havent seen it yet
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;2003JrF4i;if it doesnt have imessage i dont want it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zack Halverson;i like how rectangular it is
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;morpheus1008;only problems i see fingerprint sensor battery capacity bixby price  still an impressie phone but ill probably wait for the next generation
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sam Abtahi;my s7 edge is beatted up skipped the s8 to get the note8 was a happy note 4 and 5 user but now i just want to rebuy the s7 edge again finger print placement colors want the color midnight sapphire blue of note 5  same screen to body radio of the of the s7 edge or similar 3200 for a 57 would be acceptable dont forget the keep the headphone jack
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;K Picturee;i hate the that theyre getting rid of home buftons and the price doesnt help i was looking forward to this phone nope
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Daniel Garmon;every one is complaining about the fingerprint scanner and im like who cares i would love to have a phone this nice im using an iphone 5
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;321bluff;why stay mobile why not stay laptop
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;admorris11;manphones are seriously moving the wrong direction with the elongated screens they look horrible are impractical for one handed use and dont hold enough data from side to side

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Esmeralda Doll;ew
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Thanh Nguyen;whats holding me back is touchwiz it hasnt been kind to me at all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Harsh Vardhan;i honestly dont know what to say note lineup has always been boring and never hyped me as much as a pixel or iphone would do but you cant disagree it always makes into the ‚Äúbest phone of year‚Äù list and for valid reasons it still has headphone jack the display is still great and probably the best right now design is kinda meh unless you get the black model to hide that black camera section battery life and camera i do agree that right now wide angle seeems to be the only useful dual camera setup others seems to be like just jumping on the dual camera train because average consumers will see that it has two eyes so its likely going to take 2x better photos remains to be seen and honestly seeing how note lineup has always been successful i expected samsung to talk with google and make note 8 boot right into oreo rather than nougat  and the price  i think its a bit too much considering the leaks that ive seen i might be wrong here so feel free to correct me of pixel 2 suggesting it wont even cross 900 so its worth waiting and there are already competitions like essential phone nokia 8 still sad they didnt went with bezeless front  waiting for your review though cant give a phone a verdict by just the first impressions
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Arman M;excellent video
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Danish Firhan;443 mrmobile watches theodd1sout

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Marlous B;what about action memo
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;edris mateso;just hope it doesnt crack like the s8plus
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SPanunu;i watch a lot of tech reviewers but you and your channel stand out from the crowd while a lot of reviewers put on a cool or chill persona yours seems more genuine and warm for lack of a better word you just seem more approachable and honest in your reviews keep up the great work man
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Abood Abood;lest be honest guys an s8 is worth around 600 dollars so your telling me your willing to pay 500 dollars more for an extra camera and a useless stylus or ‚Äúspen‚Äù i‚Äôm not buying this shit the s8 is 100 times better it has the same processor and a bigger battery wtf
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Darkfire Blast;i still dont like the idea of a phone this expensive eventually slowing down to a crawl due to software also the camera module looks really ugly on the models that arent black also i am worried about battery life on this phone too other thank that it seems promising
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mr. Meeseeks;its unfortunate that the note 7 looks better than the note 8 does
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Daniel Salm;my interest is ifwhen the phone will become sluggish ive often heard its around the one year mark
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Big Cat;this is ugly phone samsung needs to understand what consumer wants and not what they want to sell

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RuinedBlackCat;watching a note 8 video on my note 4 i love my note 4 kinda hard to sell me on the note 8 maybe  in a few years ill grab a note 8 when my note 4 hit its limits

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ChubbyChecker182;lg stylus 2 is only ¬£130 and it has a stylus and a  fantastic dab radio that lasts 50 hours plus

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Joseph Barney;its pretty good but my s7 edge still works well i see no point in upgrading just yet plus the screen is huge will it even fit in my pocket
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Steve Moseti;i honestly dont know how i feel about this phone not that exciting anymore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;jairtzinio;i cant wait to not get it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Peter Ford;at least you didnt slobber all over it like others its nice no doubt but what did anyone expect samsung to do yet another grand phone thats a grand price thanks mm
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;thrasherx2k1;i played with one today at the att store because the samsung rep had one the sensor is no where near as close to the camera lens as before people need to stop whining
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Let's Talk;does it not make anyone else smile just to hear him say youll want to stick to retinal scanning your finger print scanner isnt the best thats cool ill just use the retina scanner instead the future is here my friends
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;nuyou21;üòÇ i still can‚Äôt believe it really is just a taller s8 plus with a pen and iphone camera features i thought everyone was joking üòûüíØ

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Donny Fair;lg v30 for me ladies and gentlemen wideangle secondary camera rocks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;like someone else said this is gonna be easy to surpass for apple i think the v30 has the field set to shine if lg does it right i see no point on getting a note 8 if the s8 is 90 the same and cheaper

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mohammed Yasin;god that camera on the back looks ugly as fudge on top of that add that hideous rear finger print design and something we know for sure its not going to win any beauty pageants this year
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tekky Quickbits;the fingerprint scanner placement still disappoints me i personally think this is just an s8 with an spen but with two cameras the body is just a bit less curved out basically thats it thisll probably lose the speedtests just like the s8 because of the heavy skin and bixby slowing things down
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Catch Dis L;i would rather get an s8

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sascha Kuhn;the finger print sensor is still bad placed the phone itself looks really good but finger print in that position is a dealbreaker some will say that iris scanner is a better option but we will see how that works

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CaptainAshra;i dont usually think this but that phone looks boring af design looks like a 2015 huawei model and the software looks about as standard as it could get  hopfully the v30 will make a better first impression or the pixel xl 2 for that matter
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ken Hunter;i am a huge fan and i want to share something with you please contact me on facebook at ken hunter thanks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ishneet Singh;iphone 8 will copy the bezel less screen and iris and face scanner that no one will talk about cause we have a mentality that apple creates stuff it creates shitits font and 3d touch is copied from windows phone the notification shade drop down was an android feature which was adopted in ios 5 control center is just fancy new placement for toggles in android airdrop is a rip off of android beammoreover the dual lens was created first by htc one m8so all get your facts right   companies get inspiration from each other

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rich Brown;can one of you send some haters tell me what exactly you have against the current location for the fingerprint scanner on the note 8 you spent all year complaining about it on the s8 because you will supposedly smudge up your camera lens its no longer by the camera so what is your excuse now where would be a better place for it and why
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;khalil alla;that transition to the dbrand plug was smooth af üòÇ

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;tiburonroano;you tech media people sound stupid when you say the fingerprint sensor on the s8 is bad we common people use it as a daily driver no issues only people who complain about it are the 5 second tech reviewers note 8 has even more space between the camera and the fingerprint sensor
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mike Hamilton;liked the video cuz mrmobile thumb down for the overpriced battery lacking note 8

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D S;i got used to the finger scanner on the s8 plus lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Yusuf Matini;i dont know why everyone is saying it looks ugly i think it looks awesome way better than s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jonibravo;this thing still has intolerable weaknesses for its price range
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SouthShallRise;i have an s8the fingerprint senser is not that big of a deal  i actually like using my pointer finger to hit it  its perfectly placed for that  my hands are on the smaller side so i took that into consideration when choosing models
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;chris s;s pen use a stylus with a small tip
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;jumbeaux1;samsung has really moved away from the stylusfocused notes of the past now it seems its all about the aesthetic the phone needa to be slim with curved screen hence the battery capacity   limitations  the note is no longer a workhorse
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;roguenode;i was really hoping theyd have a real wideangle coupled with the 2x meh holding to see what the v30 and iphone 8 bring
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Brandon 45;nice video man
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;FROM THE SIDE LINES!;in my opinion what makes a phone mobile is how long can it be away from its charger this is the deal breaker of any phone i look to get would like to see it pitted against  the huawei mate 9 once u have a review unit nice build quality but i can see how the finger scanner placement can be kinda frustrating
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Supah BIlly!;i hope this phone blows away the competition wait no not like that

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shah dawon;mrmobile you mentioned in the past to be able to do 2 for 1 in the multiwindow app you needed third party apps is that on the s series or the note series can you elaborate on this please i would appreciate if you could answer me without using googleinternet and checking though the old phones to give me an answer i am confused by what i am hearing from someone of your calibre along with others that has been in this industry for a very long time now  ps i along with some other old timers of tech enthusiast will be eagerly awaiting your answer
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Stillmatic084;thank you michael fisher for going in a little depth on the overall size of the battery bigger phones should have bigger batteries its just common sense make the phone thicker so that the   battery can be safely in place with out any problems id much rather sacrifice a slightly thicker phone with a bigger and longer lasting battery then a thin one with a small battery that wont get me through the whole day

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Mcrayen;how the fuck they compare a year old iphone with this dont be dumb because first 835 soc just caught with the a10 and second apple did the dual camera before samsung and after a year samsung comes with a dual camera and tells you hey its better than the one on the iphone well guess what it supposed to be better and still out stand the next iphone but its only better at fucking ois at the second camera  wtf  get your shit together samsung

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;bj classics;hi michael fisher on 349  i think samsung have gone the right way with the dual camera theyve given us both a wide angle and a telephoto lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Carlos H;the problem with samsung its that they only try to be better than the iphone and yes the iphone is a very good phone but not the best in the market it would be better if they focussed in beating the camera on the lg v series or the software experience on a pixel or even better why not try to beat the 15 price then they would have the very best phone in the market
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;BASEDGHOST100;im on contract and my mom wants to get s8 plus but i want note 8advice please
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alex J. Qeblawi;mr mobile i have been following you for a while now and loved your reviews i do have a few things to say though you try really hard to be edgy its like youre giving off the impression that you are a smug nit picker from the things you say and way you describe them this is meant as constructive criticism by the way im not trying to hate you can very obviously tell when you like the brandproduct and when you dont just dont do this weird pompous personality type that you put on to me it detracts from everything you say especially the negatives of a product i know it stirs controversy and gets more engagement on the video but i want to keep watching you cause i like real you not sassy know it all you
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;thatonebeone;all you need to knowüòÇ no point in a review
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Altema22;wait when did battery life become your most important specification i thought it was bezels  seriously though youll have to let us know how the battery holds up with that bigger screen hopefully the battery will be ahem noteworthy also curious how the note 8 feels in the hand as that was a big turnoff for me with the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;arqfran75;old design

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mikeithappen;who wouldve ever thought the s line has finally outshined the note line gotta say im a little disappointed
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aaman Chowdhury;i really like the look font and back
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SDav21;another overhyped samsung the back looks ugly also the 2 times zoom is pointless normal digital zoom works perfectly for most applications lgs wide angle is a far better implementation and makes more sense in a larger variety of situations i and many people never need to zoom much but the wide angle lense is invaluable you can just take much better pictures with a wide angle in a small room in cities inside buildings and even just for capturing more of a landscape i feel like samsung is just trying to make themselves seem better tgan apple by doing the 2 times zooms instead of giving consumers the better and more useful option like wide angle ill wait for the v30
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aby Rocky;good morning samsung galaxy note 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pushkar Pagare;price
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;tony okoro;notably larger than the s8 given theres only 01 of an inch between the two devices probably down to the stylus as i have no need for the stylus s8 for me is a better option especially when price if factored in
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ddeejay Alex;diciamo pure che far√† schifo quanto ls8 bordi edge anche sul note caxxo quando una moda √® invia basta tutto su quella strada facciamo anche i televisori coi bordi edge poi se ne vengono con  1000‚Ç¨ io dovrei spendere 1000‚Ç¨ per il note 8 che se lo mettessero su per il insieme a ls8 sta samsung sta ammazzando il mercato degli smartphone anche i cinesi si stanno adeguando montandosi la testa vorr√† dire che mi terr√≤ il mio lg g6 per altri 2 anni
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;FASHIONBYANU;michaels voice reminds me of the creepy nerd from gta 5 lester
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TDS;enough which douse edge displays i do own note 5 and now what i see is terrible bay bay samyoung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ivan Uremovic;i dont know but i expected something more out of this one its basically s8 plus with s pen but alright there are dual cameras now it will be interesting to check quality of picture and stuff notes in the past always had more powerful cpu than s series and stuff and i would like to see that back some time but yeah it really feels like weve come to the time when there is almost no inovation and every phone is almost the same thats just my opinion i probably wont get s8 or note 8 or anything similar any time soon since prices are so damn high here but yeah anyways it will be interesting to see how people will react on this one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;2clickswest;thanks for the video mr mobile hyped for that review  but what in the hell happens in the comments why the majority of the people just cant put in their heads that iphone and all the other phones are great note 8 and s8 and pretty much all the flagships that we have right now are gorgeous and capable pieces of hardware i was using android for the past 4 years and last year i switched to ios and i love and adore both of them i will stick to apple for now but i cant deny that note 8 is amazing i get the rivalry and the competition but lets not slide down that barbarian my stuff is the shit and your sucks mentality there is enough salt about it already
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mobi Adam;phone looks terrible from the back nothing more special then s8 plus just have s pen and dual cameras that does not even come close to lg g6 dual cameras if i have to buy  i would choose s8 plus
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Randy Parsons;its really about the pen  half of this video should be about the damn pen  otherwise people should probably get the s8 since its lighter and a little smaller  taking notes quickly is very very useful taking down a  phone number and address for example   you can put it into the address book later   also the screen grab and write feature is very cool  you can take a pic of a list on paper and use the pen to cross off things on the list or edit

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Deathstroke 87;ill be getting this and the iphone 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;I am the ARROW!;hi michael i dont know why they reduced the battery size i get its because theyre trying to make it safer then what happened to last years note but from what i recall it was the kind of batteries they were using  the lack of any testinginspection which was really obvious during the second recall units especially since the s8 has the exact same battery capacity as the note 7 but they actually introduced the new inspection program thanks michael
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;G Flo;somehow i was being pulled back into the note cause of the updated specs and because of mrmobiles persuasion that is until 437 seconds into the video im thankfully reminded of that stupid gimmick and that incredibly useless button yeaaahhell nah

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;The Builder's Cave;samsung hurried to release a phone that many are and will be disappointed in why not release it a bit later but instead make it better im pretty sure many of us wouldnt have a problem waiting for a bit longer
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Drncha Veverica;back of this phone is so ugly those camera sensors an that black bar oh so ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kass;why and why the finger print is near the camera cant samsung learn from one mistake and battery for this large screen wont last half a day even if your not using  a big fan of note ive had all of them but since the note 7 im honestly always hesitating to buy anything from them
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Biz 08;does anyone know why the us always gets less color options seems like a legal thing but why would the government care
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Lucas Augusto;hey michael im not sure if you can answer this but why is it that as soon as the official stream began you and some other channels posted handson videos of the note 8 at the exact same time and even before the device was even introduced in the event
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Willever;as always bravo sir üëè
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Will Blackler;what a let down
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnKnown Paradox;i have a s8 and ive gotta say is better than i expected i had every note series and a s4 when i saw samsung was making bixby and making it have its own button i thought oh shit this is going to suck now that ive had it for a while now i can saw i dont hit the bixby button and if i do its too toggle the flashlight but lets be real its samsung did away with it and just made it an app or long press on the home button it would be a lot better   ps loving bixby voice
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;loyal4 the way;3300mah is not enough   we need like 3900 or even 4000 mah
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Trenttt;where are you from and why did you leave that channel your voice is familiar
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;NuckFChorris;in this day and age battery capacity isnt a huge concern there are so many ways to charge your phone even if youre out and about all day you can go out and drop 40 on a 22000mah external battery that has quick charging and never have to worry about battery life at all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Parth Jain;how many native samsung apps does note 8 have this timecause samsung is known to put a considerable lot of bloatwarealthough they have reduced over time
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Carlo X;those rip apple or rip apple users are very immature apple has nothing to do with this video why is it that apple is in 90 of the comments  i like the note 8 seems like a really great phone im also interested in the iphone 8 grow up already
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Yvan Herrera;removable battery where is the sd card slot
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Josette, obviously.;i wish you tech guys would stop complaining about bixby let them try to compete otherwise we just have a monopoly by google on android platform competition leads to innovation aka better products for consumers that said ill wait until note 9 because im not at all pleased with the note 8 battery

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Circuit Breaker;jesus people stop whining about fingerprint reader and stop being stupid there are so many other options pattern my favorite iris scanner smart lock another my favorite  you wear a smartwatch and you dont have to unlock your phone  its automatically unlocked while your watch is connected to it also you can setup any bt device as a smartlock device and have your phone unlocked while that device is connected like bt headphones for example or a wifi router there are more httpssupportgooglecomnexusanswer6093922hlen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matthew Lemmers;i personally have the iphone 7 and i dont miss the headphone jack what i have been seeing with these videos is that even with the amount of memory this phone has it has ui lag the iphone 7 is still just as smooth as day one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cpenguiner;it looks like a concrete so boxy
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kushagra Peshin;it looks great but as a s7 edge user i hope that the software is good i felt the 60 skin was the best due to battery life 70 with the grace ux is a nightmare the s7 edge lost half the battery life with the phone heating up
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sydell;at least the fingerprint sensor is all the way on the left so you cant smudge the camera anymore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;razorwireclouds;meh software is still the ugly mess samsung always manages to make out of android

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Thomas;if you already have the s8 or s8 there is basically no point you can buy your own stylus and well who needs 2x zoom  might as well get the s8 even if you dont have it as its 750 easily found for less and not 1050 like the note 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MidlifePluto97 XboxOne;the price on older notes are going down the note 4 and 5 are still amazing phones im going to get a note 5 and still be happy as fuck

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Felix Tang;just dont bother about bixby it exists to cater android users where googles services are not welcomed also since you are sponsored by dbrand you can tell them to include skins for more phones rather than just flagships may be that would let me help both you and the sponsor themselves
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ŒìŒπŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ†Œ±œÄŒ±Œ¥ŒøœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ;if you have s8 plus just dont buy it save your money    if you got any other phone go for it  it is worth it  especially if you are note fun and you own note 5

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Joe Smooth;nothing special really just slapped a huge price tag and thats all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mohamed Alfalo;the battery size is a bit disappointing i only wish samsung would release a basic version without all the samsung apps it is crazy how much lag their phones have even with top notch specs
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ahmed Gamal;most boring phone ever nothing different than the s8 except the dual cameras which have nothing new apple realesed their telephoto and portrait mode a year ago plus it still has the horribly placed fingerprint scanner and an even smaller battery than the note7
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Harshit Singh;will presented video and that was awesome it will not blow up on your face üòÇüòÇüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sic22l;zoom camera has f24 aperture not f26 and a tiny 136 sensor so brighter lens wont really help
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Lvl95 Mewtwo;im so tired of people bitching about finger print scanner location lmao like if this phone is your daily driver and you cant get used to pushing a fucking button that never moves then youre a retard 5 days with the phone and i would never touch the camera by accident

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Straughter;mr mobile sounds like you missed the event or didnt pay very good attention the note has a wide angle lens and telephoto lens so it uses the dual camera set up as though the cameras from lg and apple had a baby it can do both

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Skadoosh Meh;if its about taking notes they shouldve made it wider not taller making these phones with dimensions similar to an a6 field book would be  more desirable
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;peter stringer;was it just me that was kinda underwhelmed by the live event and the phone there just didnt seem to be many great new features

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;6644pmr;always love the graphics used in your videos they stand out in my subscription feed very easily
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jeremy Cush;no stereo speaker option unless you root it  still i think it will sell well
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ionut Daniel Serban;i never liked samsung for its shitty software but i always kind of had a disposition to overlook that issue on the note series the note 3 and 4 in their respective times were something worth premium time and money but the note series has made a long way and in the worst direction posible  you simply cannot shit on basics and hide the failures with aesthetics extras and gimmicks that fingerpring is completly unusable and the battery being about average and that without counting the performance decrease that samsung smartphones experiences over 612 months is just lame for a almost 1k price  and the design is nothing to brag about the note 7 is much better looking despite the 169 screen ratio
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Evan West;why does everyone complain so much about the placement of the fingerprint scanner ive used the s8 and didnt have any trouble with it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hotshotinkk;all i need to do is wait for the unlocked version and then throw my iphone 7 to the garbage

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;jay syed;everyone keeps talking abt the finger prints on the rear camera try to take one picture with the finger print on the camera honestly it doesnt make a difference i have the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;David hunsinger;the instant deal breaker for me for this phone the bixby button ill wait to see the pixel xl 2
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Diego Sanchez;overpriced crap software poor design i mean samsung phines are great and all from hardware but the flagships as every other brand are overpriced and touchwiz is still aweful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dkimmortal;people who buy this should only buy it for the spen otherwise get a much cheaper s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dario Lindner;so does that mean that the s8 is going to drop in price
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Demonz NCreeperz;the galaxy s9 will be the first phone ever to have a fingeprint scanner imbedded into there screens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dkimmortal;that extra large glass combining the flash and the lens causes at least on the g6 glass crack from heatcool temperature variations like when you use the flash as a torch for a while or video record with it on for a while hope the note 8 does not have this issue
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;BULLET DIARIES;the video i always wait for thanks a lot sir
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;rajesh reddy;samsung should have put the camera sensor between 2 cameras  figerprint sensor at bottom  of camera and made a face  would be good than this ugly side by side design
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Carl Evans;early days  shite colours
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Redowan Nafi;s8 looks better imo
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Chirag  Prajapati;note 8 accessebility features in your review
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;PRATHEESH;so samsung doesnt want their flagship phone users to use a fingerprint user by placing it  with the camera
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;David Whitt;in a world with portable and fast charging i dont really care if my battery last all day its easier than ever to charge them
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aakarsh Garg;love the new blue colour üòç
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Widyastika;damnnn that phone is uglier than my face
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;defender of the good;for whatever reason im noticing bezel more and more
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Muhammad Imran;hi  does anyone tell me about the price in us dollars and when it will be in kyrgyzstan
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;youssef fetouh;i think the s8 is still better because they update the camera and the s pen there was non surprises in the keynote like samsung dex with s8 keynote and for anywone who wants to buy it i think you better wait we still dont know if it explodes or not
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JDM CJM;if you moan about the fingerprint sensor you either dont own an s8s8 or you have some odd non human hands that couldnt get use to it after using it as a daily driver for more than a week its so easy to unlock with or without a case
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Medina;can you confirmin your next review if the phone will or will not have hdr10 orand dolby vision screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MI55ION;totally agree with you about the battery size major deal breaker for someone like me who already has the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Stevie Rios;note 7 was better looking anyways im waiting for a price drop and you should too they shouldnt have rushed it and waited for the sd836  not worth 1000 retail price with no sd836 no dual speakers and no 4k screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Laurie LFH;i havent had any problems with the placement of the fingerprint scanner on the s8 for me it was easy to use because my hand naturally rested in that location it took all of a few hours in one afternoon to learn the different feel and location from that as opposed to the camera lens for me it was no problem at all and i actually like the location now i have really enjoyed my current s8 it takes beautiful photos its especially a jewel for taking low light pics i can actually take my phone kayaking and paddle boarding with me with no fears of it getting water splashed about its fast and i have experienced no lags at all i have fantastic storage with the added micro sd on board the oled screen is gorgeous you cant top oled for rich colors i purchased the note 7 last year and it was the best phone i have ever had it had everything that i wanted in a phone and much much more mine never got hot it never even got close to it so yes it was tough giving it up i ended up purchasing an iphone 7 and had it for exactly a month i just felt like i had stepped back about five years or more in technology i know its just a phone but as much as we use our phones today you really would prefer to buy a phone that you enjoy using i felt like it was the same iphone that i had from two years before because basically it was with the most minor of freshening up here and there so i sold my iphone and went to the google pixel then the samsung s7 edge which brings me currently to my s8 i had owned the note 5and i really did use that spen all the time so im excited about this new note 8and will be preordering on day one i feel samsung has tested the battery issues in every possible way and im not worried about safety or performance samsung knows it has to hit this one out of the park on these very important issues to regain and keep note fansand samsung in general im not a brand fanatic i have owned way too many of them but i love new technology i buy and use what i love using its different for each person some people want to try different brands but feel theyre too far immersed in their specific brands as far as specific apps smart home devices tablets and other gear so its all about those choices and what you want from your device as for me i am more than ready for this new note 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Elusian;when the best tech reviewer out there shares the same concerns about the phones primary hardware focus that companies seems to go the opposite way in 2017  the battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;jake cooper;when i was in the process of  purchasing a new phone i watched every gadetphone channel on youtube to try and get the best opinion ive got said new phone s8 and ive kinda stopped watching all of them bar one mr mobile still makes me come back for more reminding me of that little gadget whore that lives in the back of my mind lusting after newest and best great video cant wait for the full review ü§ô

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jerdeen Williams;wonder if samsung would be open to looking for help from another company like say huawei on how to get a big battery in there and have it work no way is a larger capacity battery a bad thing when implemented right optimizing a small battery for good endurance is never going to be as good as optimizing a larger battery for great endurance

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;otakukj;very underwhelmingsamsung had a big chance to innovate here and blow us all awayin the end they just stuck with the safe route and insisted on gouging ussince when is the camera a huge selling point of the note series there s so much more they could have done with the most important selling point which is the s pen im getting the note 8 but i gotta say i am really not that  impressedall the rumors about a 4k screen how did they drop the ball on that one a better vr experience would have been much appreciated
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pety;the note line has gotten closer and closer to the s line every year and by now i just dont see a point in most people buying it but im glad to see the note back in action
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tams80;i love the spen but that battery  the fingerprint sensor location also the lack of a dedicated camera button especially on a waterproof phone baffles me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Gamer Nexus;this guy is a hater
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;n!tromy;michael i know that the bixby feature is horribly outdated compared to the rest of the competition out there ive tried it in store so i can see why thatd be very frustrating but could you please understand that this was a feature originally launched in south korea where they wanted to cater to their own demographic first i wish samsung thought this ai through a little better but constantly talking smack isnt really going to help either because language barriers are a challenge on its own  otherwise thanks for the first look and cant wait for your full thoughts on it soon
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;akm qb;it is a piece of unusable shit
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TJ;i returned my 8 because of the shitty placement of the fingerprint sensor and the bixby button you would think after every single reviewer pointed those things out they would have changed it i used to love the note line but now as ive matured and no longer need to have the latest and greatest ill wait till my g6 starts having problems and get a pixle 2
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;creg marte;i guess ill wait for the galaxy s9
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Manuel Herrero;hey mr  mobile does the s pen still have the option to use it as a magnifier for small print on screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;PressBoxFilms;so darn disappointing i was about to switch back from apple as an original note importer from the note 1 through 4 it‚Äôs selling point was being a battery beast that was almost a super drive blackberry sure the pen was great but the large squarish screen and 2 day battery life is what made the 1 and 2 legendary even the 4 with a battery pack on it so you had 5 day batttery life was just awesome too bad they made it so commercial and it‚Äôs basically a joke now i miss the good ole days with a real samsung note thought they were going back to their roots after the note fires
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;NORSHUTTLE;cant understand how the fingerprintsensor is that bad yes its ugly that its not centered but my personal experience having the s8 is that its very easy to use just when you get used to it i dont have particulary big hands but i never struggle to find it smudge the camera etc  the note 8 will probably cost around  1300 us dollars here in norway and thats yeah
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;David Appleton;am i the only one that doesnt like the infinity screen when you look at your tv or even look out of a window the edges dont rap around when the phone is full screen watching a video it just looks weirdit seems to make the edges look blurry the rest of the phone is greati love the functionally of all the new dual cameras
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sentry :D;a question for all s8s8 owners when i got my s8 a month ago the default navigation button color was black you could change it to any color it was almost like full rgb with punchy colors i set it to white just to test it out one update came and the only colors you could pick were white ones with different tones all really bright but there is no black anymore and it is really annoying if there is anyone who could help me and maybe others aswell with this i would really appreciate it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Victor Tubandt;ill never buy a phone with a dedicated bixby button
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Patrick Castilleja;no price
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pigmon Ford;first time i ever felt that the note looks worse than the s this is just a s8 with a stylus disappointing
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Devo Fauzan Rahman;skip
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alexander May;i thought it had a wide angle lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;FiiF;nothing weve never seen before samsung literally sucks  im a pixel  htc fan
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D- Sean;i have the note 5 and it doesnt lag and it is just as fast as day one so all this samsung phones slow down after awhile isnt true because all phones slow down eventually
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Joakim Persson;note 4 had 2 for 1 app shortcuts
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;muhd.suresh kumar rangasami;bye bye iphoneyoure too old skool
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dehidro;there was a time where i had to have the newest smartphone but nowadays i dont care anymore i just dont now i buy last years flagship or one a half year old flagship the difference between a 835 and 820 is not that much dual cameras sure they are useful me myself had a nexus 6 loved it till it died on me 2 months ago now i bought the huawei p9 for 299 euros dont get me wrong i can afford each and every smartphone there is but do i need it no i dont the specs on the p9 are good fast processor enough ram dual cameras
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Littletime;meagre battery less blowy uppy second rear cam not wideangle fingerprint scanner next to camera and and prominent bixby im going to wait and see what pixel 2 has to offer
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ankit Yadav;no idea about note 8 but mrmobile as always is great
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;tour guide;those who cant buy it says note 8 is ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rajesh Dabhade;rip iphone 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xenia and Vadim Kim;odd1sout
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Garry;come on bets are open  which phone will be the first with 4 cameras on the back normal zoom wide angle and bw detail sensor xiaomi have to be the early favourite
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Arjun K;why are you talking so much negative about a phone you only spend with 5 hours  shame
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;James M;i wonder how long i have to wait for the 256gb unlock international model to hit the us
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vale Rossi 46;does it have edge to edge features like the s8 this could be the major deciding point for me i do want to buy the phone it looks fabulous
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ayaz Sattar;europeans getting a raw deal with the free gifts compared to the americans but are we going to get the 425 off the phone price if we had the note 7 knowing how sammie treats non americans probably not if thats the case wont be getting the note 8 was waiting to get after my note 7 but they treated europeans badly for the note 7 returns not getting as much in return for the note 7 recalls
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rez1 Hossain;am i the only one who doesnt like that camera area no only me then
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cheeriomartinez;if it has the bixby button im not going to get it fuuuck that
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Edwin;everyone is complaining about the fingerprint sensor location again but at least we still have it cough cough iphone if rumors are true
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ape Science;this phone is pure garbage fucking ugly thing
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eduardo Hernandez;when is the v30 coming out
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ahmed Mokhtar;mrmobile i hoped you would talk about the performance of the device and if is it capable to go one vs one with last year iphone noting that this year iphone didnt release yet and if it has that samsung s lags because of software and what about benchmark im afraid that your hands on didnt tell me anything about lags or efficiency  hope in the review video you talk more about performance and whether it lags
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Viktor S.;am i the only one that doesnt hate the design
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ishmeet Singh;looks so ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Isaax;the battery is a bad joke just like the whole note lineup after the note 4
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Venka Dx;tired to hear the fingerprint placement  for my large fingers when i take the phone with my right hand  my index finger naturally goes to the place where the fingerprint exists today on the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vandrefalk;oh man i dont like mrblurrycam either but mrmobile i like a lot d
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eddy Nelson Lopez;hide that nav bar please ive been trying to hit the dot the entire video üòÇüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mohammed Azar;does it have self destruct function
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Abu Encontrado;for god sake  that spen that everyone talks about is useful only for couple of weeks when you have the phone with you  unless you create content or you sketch else that is just a piece of hardware tightly secured in its slot  i mean does the screen matter so much battery killer it is and not to forget the lag it comes with after couple of months ive never seen a note user use spen so much that it is intended to  and yea ive owned 2 generations of note phones and the bloatware that it comes with  is ridiculously  high
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;–ê–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–º;ive been sitting on an upgrade for 4 months now finally the note 8 has arrived üòÄüòÄüòÄ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mikey Dee;nah ill wait for mate 10 this is just a slightly better s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;shehryar zaheer;i think that samsung is placing the fingerprint in such location to make its users use its iris scanner more than the fingerprint and for me this phablet doesnt seem beautiful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ka√Ø Zoku;would be so cool if they add 3 cameras like the wild one from lg normal from them and zoom one from iphone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Wisarut Aroonkayan;wow you guys got the phone before they release it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;j317;im a die hard note fan but i must admit this phone is pretty disappointing and i hate how they do that stupid shit and make the us wait to get the gold color i am seriously considering the iphone 8 plus
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;tat3r_t0t 99;the dbrand ad placement was smoooooooooth üòâ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andrea C;the orchid gray version doesnt look purplish anymore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SUPER USER;worlds best phone

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JUDVS;i like the fingerprint sensor position     said no one ever
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;R Schroeder;great video michael thank you
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hunter Houghton;well im sorry samsung but this is ugly i thought your phones were supposed to be premium and look nice but it looks like a boxy thick mess ugh the camera with heart rate sensor and fingerprint scanner all together on the back   ugly in my opinion
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;xAmadeusHen;at 335 the camera comparison between the iphone 7 and note 8 seems really odd the camera app on the iphone seems a little bit different from the standard one and the woman on the note 8 seems to be poorly photoshopped because of the white parts around her face strange
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Black Knight - GAMING;im so happy that the note 8 got released     now i will be able to afford the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Varun Kashib;i guess now the s8 is the best phone and the note 8 is the best phablet in the market at least the best samsung has ever made
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Arun Jose Mathew;it looks neat appart from the fact that the fingerprint is in the wrong place but it looks good for the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;adavid9155;omg yesüòä
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shaya Maddex;getting an old note 4 today lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;I_THE_ME;i dont see any reason why to upgrade to this from lets say s8 4 gigabytes of ram should be more than enough for a mobile device if its not then theres something horribly wrong with the optimization of the os the telephoto lens is from what ive seen much less useful than one with no colour filter or a wide angle fish eye lens the battery is just too small for a smartphone this size and dex cant replace your computer if you do anything more demanding than basic video or photo editing and this is all coming from a person whose daily driver neither runs ios nor android
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hassan Hamed;better to call it the best and most complete mobile device in the world
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;HARLAN P;tapping tiny touch targets tapping tiny touch targets tapping tiny touch targets tapping tiny touch targets
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Stefos;high quality dac
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Woetie B;400 in the presentation it was told that there was a wide angle lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mark Liston;i dont know what its for just a blown up s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;keep looking;nice phone indeed too many people go on about the lg wide angle setup but in reality the barrel distortion on many of those images is too strong is shots generally but yes it is a nice option
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Wu;the back is ugly af and the toorectangular shape makes it look like a long brick probably due to the screens aspect ratio the s8 looked perfect tho but it seems they didnt want it to look too much like it whoever made the design decisions here should be sacked
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SuJu_Mimi;here straight from the live stream d
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mike M;well then google pixel it is üëéüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Clarence Tsang;would definitely have preferred wide angle lens to 2x zoom i am overseas for a month so do i get friend to preorder or get exynos version in asia
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Md. Abdul Ahad Chowdhury;why is the background music so muted it is one of the unique features of mrmobiles videos which i enjoy a lot
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TechLineHD;i wish samsung implemented a wideangle secondary camera much more useful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Richy Calculus;am scared of buying notes because when the pen gets missing i will be fucked
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xarc Factor;1000 for this phone nope i can buy a decent car with that maybe a gaming laptop
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rehman Khan;every one should only use earphones while talking on this phone it can go boom any time
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ahsan Khurshid;who else wasnt that excited for the note 8 especially because of the positioning of the fingerprint and nothing much has changed from the note 7 except for the dual camera and the screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MarkC538;telephoto  wide angle
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jonathan Rivera;damn this thing is ugly especially that cluttered mess on the back
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;M I C H;what a low life haters here haha
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RICKY SEKHON;basically they are selling s8 with dual cameras  spen   where is note squadüòÇüòÇüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;The Cheshire Cat;i mean i get that the fingerprint scanner is in a shitty location but you really do get used to it ive had my s8 for about a month now and i think ive only ever put my finger on the camera lens once its not that bad but then i am a freak of nature and do have abnormally long fingers
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;1pt21gw;a big meh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;PianoVideosJustForU;fingerprint scanner position is meh but the battery capacity is disappointing skipping this one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;DrClaw77;samsung why did you not bring the blue model to the us market coral blue was a big seller  im just going to wait since i smell a best buy special down the line hopefully that would also mean we could get it unlocked
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Samuel Castro;hey michael it can do wide angle photos aswell
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alxi Frenzen;ohhhhh michael this is quick
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Thotles army;finally the beast is here
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Martin Eugeniev;i am in love
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Saktuscactus;luckily 7 and 8 dont sound similar
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Schmevin;extra hardware buttons are the worst  i have an active s5 which has an extra active button and two years later i still hit it multiple times daily  so awful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Anas M.I;doesnt seem like a note at all after s8 we expected much from samsung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cross;i could care less about battery capacity if i could just get some flagships with some replaceable batterieslike its 2017 u would think they can get a removable battery with water proofing the whole nexus 6p battery issue is just stupidif not make it easy as hell to open ur phone to replace the battery yourself
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;howie Getants;the black camera slab stands out too much ruined such a beautiful design almost perfect againwhy cant sammy just make it perfect this time sigh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Julian Lawrie;i cant comprehend why companies dont understand that a super wide angle secondary camera is by far the best way to go the lg g6 will continue to be my go to device until someone does the camera software and hardware better
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sicom;not ordering this until its available in blue
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;elmtube;such a bad deal compared to s8 unless you need s pen but still bad value
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mamo;new phone release just start with the mrmobile video its the best place to start
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;David Baptista da Silva;1019‚Ç¨ 1200 in portugal people paying this much for the note need serious and urgent psychiatric treatment
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Social Jetlag;24th is mai sisters birthday
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;karis gregory;these big ass phones are way too overrated55 is the biggest most people want so you can easily use one hand not 2
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;DJ GMONEY;well i always bought the note on the day it became available if the blue is not available for the us i will be waiting stupid idea not to make it available on day 1
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Speedy Prince;waitwhat  63 inch screen but only 3300mah battery only let me guess sot under 4 hours or even less
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;elpinto007;definitely would want to know about the battery what use is a power house phone if it doesnt make it past afternoon tea

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Simon Says;with bezels becoming thing of the past  is it getting more uncomfortable to hold
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ElFenomeno92;for the first time that i feel the note series phone is nothing special anymore except for the stylus dual camera and rectangular design theres nothing different from the s8 i will just look forward to v30 and mate 10 then
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;A Sam;haha mono speaker in 2017 fail
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Fluffy Fuyumi;would be much better with vanilla android and without that retarded ass bixby button that aside its design is alright
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ardimo Harsa;everything looks fine aside from the placement of the fingerprint sensor  wish samsung will learn for s9 and note 9
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;kyohachi;ill just wait for oneplus5t
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jeemut Pratim Das;all things considered does this mark the end of the note lineup as the power users dream due to the reduced battery capacity if so the series has definitely lost its mojo
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Luke et;i think 6gb of ram is one of the best upgrades here i think the reason touch wizz grace ux lags so much is because its a heavy os which requires more ram so hopefully no more samsung lag
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;PatrickWrennMusic;the back of it is so imposing with those cameras i love it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;DeepteshLovesTECH;wow haters are on full force üòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;amal stark;is it now easy to unlock the phone with fingerprint or are u touching the cameragood impressions review

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;muhammad sajjad;the king is crowned üòç
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Halcyon;man i just wish people would do the wide angle lens approach more its only lg so far and its so much more useful than better zoom
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Maen Marashdeh;samsung always try to compare it self to apple people don‚Äôt buy iphones because of there technology but buy it for the software and name brand it gave itself 10 years ago
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;HarryPottard;instant like üòé

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rom Prakash;meh this looks like a subpar effort by samsung especially with the stuttery mess that is touchwiz it even stutters in this video too bad they are the only ones with a pen solution which makes it the only game in town for some people
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;pijesz;just 3300 battery inside the huge housing how the heck did lenovo crammed a 5000 battery inside the p2 then

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;LowEye GT;skip on this one guys the phone is fucking ugly wait for s9 or buy iphone 8 or galaxy s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Daniel Trejo;how curious about how good or bad the battery life is and how about ram management also you didnt say anything about the android version but i guess it will be running nougat since the oreo was just announced very recently looks like a good phone but samsung has to do an excelente almost perfect one in order to make people forget about the note 7 disaster
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Siddesh Gannu;i wanna know if its gonna be worth the big bucks that i might have to throw at it is it really worth it or is it just slightly better than the galaxy s8 and s8 ive owned samsung phones before i switched to iphone but im not sure if this phone will be worth my money
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;adi ansari;the back looks amazing on the blue one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Leonardo Zepeda;i still think that my s7 is one of the best samsung phones to date ive never liked big phones the s8 is a great but i still prefer the s7

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vinoth Bubblu;dude awesome review
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;xpresspritam;being more performance oriented while using a smartphone is it really worthy upgrade from galaxy s8apart from the camera and spen department
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RixterTube;i never accidentally hit the bixby button when trying to reach for the volume keys i dont get how it feels so different and the current bixby updates made bixby very useful in using native phone actions and i mean very useful i use every time its seems these reviewers dint even try reviewing bixby just nitpicking sad to think why they call themselves reviewers lol

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;megase 9;never clicked so fast in ma life
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;John Smith;i really was hoping they wouldnt stretch the screen i am not a fan of this elongated design i would have preferred the note 7 dimensions with thin bezels maybe next year
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sanjeev Aher;looks like a brick
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Devon Calixte;the samsung galaxy note 8 is a beautiful design and is so much better then the samsung galaxy s8 and s8 and more powerful biggest screen slightly but its just a shame about the battery on the note 8 it could be bigger in milliamps like 4400 milliamp battery which would be soooooo ideal for the samsung galaxy note 8 but i know its risky for samsung to put a bigger battery in the note 8 because of explosions but still it would be better to have a bigger battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;m1rchegfn;love your videos dude you cheer me up with them keep up with the good work
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hardian Candra;to people who complaining about the fingerprint scanner place 1 would you buy this phone or not  if not then dont hate it and stop complaining about it you wouldnt use it anyway  2 if you would buy this phone then its still the 8th series of the phone yeah they skip 6th so they attend to make the design similiar to the s8 and if the note 8 use fingerprint scanner somewhere else embedded to the display maybe  then it will outperform the galaxy s8people would think to buy the note 8 thehn buy the s8  sorry for bad english
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Icy Cubey;443  jaaaaaaames

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;BGChicago;hey here is a great idea make the screen 1859 but keep camera sensor 43 perfect here is a better idea do it again 4 months later  oh and wait lets not forget to make it harder and harder for users to access the most accessed menu  swipe down notificationquick toggles we should do a 359 phone next time brought to you by snapchat crowd

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Akshay Vaishnav;just a big s8 plus with a pan sad but true
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Palash Kale;people said 8 gb oneplus 5 ram was overkill you have to have more ram than samsung phone its beautiful though but the s8 still looks more beautiful due to the curved design but this is also awesome looking phone cant afford it though
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dx Sakib;thank you samsung for releasing  note 8 now finally i can buy note 4
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mr Kanobi;at least samsung is being careful with the battery this time around

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Un-Joshed;why do i feel like there is no longer a need for a note series phone since the s8 and s8 plus are really big
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jonghwa Kim;i wonder how much this costs an arm and a burnt leg
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Karthik Nagarajan;in my view there is no spec more important than battery thats my kinda reviewer no matter what display or camera or processor a phone has its a dead piece of brick when its battery runs out soon
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Douglas Jorge;why you have to make so many unnecessary negative comments about the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;LeBeautiful;mr mobile the goat mobile reviewer no need to watch the unpacked event when i have this üì≥

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Audie Liem;funny that phone backs are getting uglier and uglier as the front is getting more and more gorgeous  note 8 is the first one to enter the ring  now lets wait for the iphone 8 pixel xl 2 and specifically the v30 for the holiday competition  but who care the iphone and samsung will end up on top 2 sales chart anyhow
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Concept Creator;i am jist not sold on this note 8 the last time i was really intrested in a samsung device was with the s7 edge they arent punchin the boundries anymore they are just following them

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Parker;i have had all notes i am disappointed with this one that battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt Terry;that deep blue looks magnificent
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mo101epic;ive given up on the note 8 that ugly mess of sensors on the back basically goes against the excellent design of most samsung phones get an s8 plus if you must have something from samsung or else get a pixel 2 or iphone 8  edit to all you people who think im overreacting i agree that design isnt everything in fact i usually prioritize performance over design but i still need my phone to look somewhat decent and note 8 just doesnt do that for me is it wrong to buy a dell xps 15 over a gaming laptop if you want high performance but still want something that doesnt look hideous plus it costs 900 for the thing is it wrong to expect it to at least be somewhat nice to look at
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mike;looks like apple should easily clean house with the iphone8 weak effort samsung

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JoeyGaming;s5 really id recommend an s7 because it has many pluses that the s5 has  minus removable battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;and why should i have to for the money this should have a proper sized battery period actually having a smaller battery plus add a larger screen and you have a huge fail
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MikeTheSith200;michael livote but were talking s8 here
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MikeTheSith200;michael livote i have placed my replacement note 5 next to my note 5 and didnt experience anything that i would call lag
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;i can all but guaranty that if you got a brand new n5 and placed it next to your n5 you will see lag some folks just get used to itim not one of them for the money i expect my phone to keep on humming along smoothly with as little lag as possible for as long as possibleand sammy just cant do it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cacingtanah cicakkobeng;michael livote wowmy note 5 never lags
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;my s7 edge was lagy after only a month of use and even after a wipe and reload of my few apps that i useall well used ones i might add it still doesnt run anywhere near as good as when i first got it had the same issues with the s5 before it as well my friend has had the s8 since it came out and yup lagits a samsung app issue and it has to do with them always trying to cram replacement apps for perfectly fine google apps that arent needed or even wanted half the time bloat is the name of that tune and until samsung sucks it up and finally figures out that google is better than them and all their replacement apps are good for is slowing things down  this will continue forever got it good
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cacingtanah cicakkobeng;fendera go get em boyzz
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Fendera;yes the v30 got my attention but i heard that it has also rounded edges the g6 looks nice too
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;go for the g6 or wait a bit more for the v30 both are far better choices than this one the g6 especially im looking forward to the v30 so i can finally get a taste of what the latest chipset combined with the best camera software and hardware can dolg is doing a fine job this year more than making up for the past few years definitely worth a check out

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tyler Eberhardt;nah same phone just with smaller battery and a pen not worth it imo the standby time is better though but still not worth the hassle of getting rid of your s8 and trying to get more money for the note

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sky people;mr meeseeks fk off noob
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;WalrusEmpire;mr meeseeks hey atleast the front looks nice
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andrei Francu;mr meeseeks even the note 4 doesgo home samsung youre drunk
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dillon T;damien mcgrath i dont want to carry batteries around with me though kind of annoying
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Damien McGrath;dillon t just get a note 4 and buy a few batteries and a charger and youllnever get battery anxiety again quad hd too
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Damien McGrath;me too great phone it also had a quad hd display something that the s5 did not have the note 4 was a powerhouse spec wise and the only thing missing for me to this day three years later is water resistance
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dita Anggraini;dillon t and dont forget to upgrade it to nougat it saves battery more
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dita Anggraini;dillon t yeah i guess so moreover if its a brand new i think it will last more
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dillon T;dita anggraini so if i buy one brand new from ebay ect  i should be able to expect around 5 or so hours in screen time then right im not trying to be annoying im just trying to figure out what the screen on time is like because ive been told by some people that its pretty bad
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dita Anggraini;dillon t well after 2 years it takes 23 hours to drain almost half of the battery on full use youtube gps draw on s note etc draining 3040 on 3hours music listening and when you didnt use it that much you still have ¬±40 till night  still nice for me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dillon T;ruinedblackcat  can you give a average screen on time i watch videosmovies email music browse the web on my phone would u say its close or above 5 hour range for screen on time
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RuinedBlackCat;dillon t its ok it should last the day if your not a heavy user
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dillon T;dita anggraini how is the battery life im thinking of buying one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dita Anggraini;im on my note 5 and i think ill keep this till the next note release note9 or 10 probably
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alper Akg√ºl;ruinedblackcat im on my note 2 was gonna upgrade to 7 now i dont like the note 8 i use the spen a lot which is the only thing thats stopping me from getting the s8 i dont know what phone i should get note2 is almost dead
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cacingtanah cicakkobeng;blackye note 4 is still goodjust wait for new phones to come out
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andrei Francu;ruinedblackcat the note 4 was the best note ever made
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];lets talk ha yes good point
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;mason dydykcompeau well i only saw the popcorn emoji just now ‚òπÔ∏è
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mason Dydyk-Compeau;mobiledecay that might just be the point i believe this is what the humans call a joke
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;pwnrmasta you spelled it exactly the same therefore no one knows what youre saying
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mike Lechner;personally i like both brands and operating systems
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xalataf;will wunsche i would say its ok but since im usually a leftie ill most likely block one camera
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Bl Chitu;will wunsche in future only    mobile which uses stock android
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eric P;will wunsche its samsung apple and lg now
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];this x1000
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];stole it from rene ritchie over at imore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];negative single mono speaker on the bottom im afraid
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vedant Nagar;mrmobile michael fisher already did
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];thanks feel free to share
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];thanks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no but if past strategy is any indication id say we see new colors possibly including blue hitting the market in 69 months
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];i have no idea what youre talking about with regard to reactivating messages and yes i wish we could have this discussion face to face the only difference here is the app pair feature which launches two custom apps at the same time nothing about the multiwindow implementation itself has changed at all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shah dawon;mrmobile michael fisher did you only just reactivate the messages after disabling it for a while wow it is true then the power and allusion of the internet i didnt expect a simple question to lead to this anyway i have my answer nowhave a good day
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shah dawon;mrmobile michael fisher loli wish i could have this conversation with you face to face this would make a great video cast with your suscribbers i would disagree with you on the point regarding this feature is new starting from note 8 i say this feature has been there since s3 days apart from the fact you could only use certain stock samsung apps since the days of s3 to note4 it is possible to do this with a few extra apps such as whattsapp instagram and so on note series already has something called the preset custom windows correct me if you think im wrong
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no problem i know youre just asking a question and no not all apps are compatible with multiwindow nothing about that has changed the only difference with the note 8 is that you can now launch two apps directly into sidebyside mode at once instead of dragging them into place each time
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shah dawon;mrmobile michael fisher first of all thank you for your response to my question  i would like to point out your answer is quite vague in my opinion are you saying stock apps or all and any 3rd party apps are now able to launch in 2 for 1 in multiwindow from the side panel  i would like to stress the fact i am not hear to show you up or insult you in anyway again if you can please elaborate on this topic i would greatly appreciate this
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];multiwindow has been possible on samsung phones for a long time and on stock android since 70 but launching two apps at the same time and having them automatically launch into sidebyside multiwindow which samsung calls app pair is new to samsung phones with the note 8 afaik it was previously only possible with a thirdparty app
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tay Jacks;dnaspower ikr
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Iron Pikachu;thats the problem with most people these days where there was never really a problem someone important says there is and suddenly its a gamebreaking bug
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;d3xLP 's Sci-Fi Channel;i got my s8 now since launch and i did not miss the fingerprint reader once why instead of getting on it from anywhere to hit it somewhere i just swipe in from the left of the phone directly on to the fr problem solved in 2 seconds just used the brain instead of just taking the words every single tec journalist on this planet told because someone important said it first
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;June Bugg;mrmobile michael fisher theres nothing about the note 8 that makes me want to pre order it tbh my s8 plus is better well thats what i think honestly i dont think many people will get it and sales for the note 8 will take a hit i cant wait to get the iphone 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ian Cabrera;mrmobile michael fisher very nice next do a first iphone vs first galaxy comparison üî•üî•

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Daniyal12 Rashid;sski66  5th september
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sski66;yes i agree but can u answer my question what date are the preorders over
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TessellatedGuy;i love the samsung bundles with preorders preorders are probably the best time to buy a flagship samsung phone because of how many extra goodies you get which essentially lower the cost
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sski66;does anyone know how long preorders last i couldnt find the info is it right up until it ships on 915 or sooner anyone have the date thanks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;logic buffer;google assistant is awesome and everyone loves it no doubt but bixby is geared towards in app tasks and phone settings that other prominent assistants currently do not handle so well i feel bixby and google assistant dont overlap much in functionality and bixby is unlike other samsung gimmicky features of s4 era again opinion differs the dedicated bixby button on other hand is a whole new debate
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;its actually easy to dismiss it when google assistant works so great out of the boxand doesnt place a useless button on the phone to need to use it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];itll be interesting to try in the real world again thats for sure
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;- Immortalian -;apple did not manage to rek android for 3 years now why should it change
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alex J. Qeblawi;mrmobile michael fisher thank you for taking the time to reply i get what youre saying but i just want to clarify that what i meant with those comments is that the impression you give off with some of the negatives that you point out on the phone in the video in terms of tone and language are what i am commenting on not necessarily attacking you as a person theres some content creators that have similar means of speaking aswell as presenting and i dont really enjoy that tonality i didnt mean to offend i just said how i felt i probably took it too far and for that i apologise
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];lemme get this straight you accuse me of trying to be edgy and of nitpicking you call me pompous and sassy and a knowitall  and then on top of all that you accuse me of just doing it as a puton for engagement but youre not trying to hate sorry dude but youre hating and its annoying im not putting on a personality or angling for a better ld ratio with my tone of voice im just being me if you dont like it youre welcome to take your views elsewhere
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];ha freal so friggin tired of all the bezel obsession in the comments
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;NickandM;pushkar pagare a little bit over 1000

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];nonremovable battery microsd slot is up top
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;shashwat panda;mrmobile michael fisher so the g6 still holds the crown in this aspectgood for me i own one üòÄüêº
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no its listed as wide angle but only as compared with the telephoto its actual fov is pretty conventional
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];k
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Raf O;i understand but i just dont think there is a single person on this earth who is interested in n8 is not aware of the n7 issues  rant over youre still the best mobile reviewer and will continue to subscribe i only subscribe to 5 channels
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];frankly im tired of it too you have no idea how tired i am of the same tired jokes in the comments from people who think theyre clever but putting the note 8 in context for a broad audience requires discussion about the note 7 its part of the note 8s story like it or not
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];google personal preference
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];ive never found it terribly compelling as it seems really inefficient no matter how wellexecuted it is
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kaius P;its ugly af

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;speak proper english you terrorist
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;cacingtanah cicakkobeng;zamil hasan what in the name of fuck r u talking about
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zayla Larue;zamil hasan lol u are retarded son lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;zamil hasan;lol üòÅone more joke please  who will buy this device  where 6 finger prints scanner at 6 inchof course they are not human üòÜ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kevin Straughter;mrmobile michael fisher good point i dont typically let marketing sway me but youre right hey i can admit when im bested i personally dont think the phone is worth 100 more than the s8 yeah its added a telephoto lens 2gb ram and some gimmicks all the while shaving 200mah off the battery do you think its worth the price hike
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];sounds more like youre relying on marketing copy for your data the wide angle claim in samsungs literature is just the company trying to differentiate the primary lens from the telephoto one yes its wider than the secondary lens but its fov looks no wider than the s8 camera   source spent two hours with the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no the difference with apppair is that it launches both apps simultaneously im not talking about multiscreen itself
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Funkentelechy;mrmobile michael fisher thanks for clearing it up
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];its ip68
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dkimmortal;this is why the lg v30 design is different and the flash is in its own glass housing though it does spoil the symmetry a bit which the g6 has done beautifully
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt 958;jays car reviwes haha not funny
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jerdeen Williams;johnmade69 no argument there that is not the point however the point is samsung is claiming they dont want a repeat of the note 7 saga they blamed the battery capacity huawei has large batteries in their mate series and there has never been any such accidents im not talking about huaweis optimization abilities
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;jerdeen williams samsung puts larger batteries bigger than huawei in their midrange devicesidiot
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;jerdeen williams huawei phones have bigger battery but arent optimized so it sucks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ass Kisser;mashlegend trust me its not a joke it actually lusts longer than my s 8 it i s an amazing device
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Bl Chitu;mashlegend iphone dont even have 3000 mah üòÇüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eric P;how is 3300 a joke when most phones have 33003500 mah
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Joshua Toliver;mashlegend there was a big battery last time and it exploded
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pelle;smartphones have been made for many years now and they have made sure it wont burn this time its a good phone for sure top of the line im getting one and i wont regret it and battery will be good enough to at least last me a day using it a lot maybe not watching videos all the time or recording or having camera on im gonna have fun with this phone for years to come enjoy your coming shitty shit phones bye
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MashLegend;wasiq rashid iphone 7 is a much smaller device half the size if note 8 note 8 should have 3800mah
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aleksa;well neither the iphones have huge batteries
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Wasiq Rashid;iphone 7 has 1960 mah but of course no one complains about that
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Prashanth Murali;clearly you havent used the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tyler Eberhardt;johnmade69 samsung hardly has optimization
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;mashlegend optimization is key
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pelle;okay that sounds nice ive seen live streamers that walk around outside using a phone for recording and if they use a powerbank to charge it cant keep up with how much is being used on the phone to record the stream and the stream ends because the phone wont stay on but yeah if they had another battery to put inside the phone it might help but then the phone would turn off i guess maybe idk a solution
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Omar Ben Sassi;themusketituckedit i hope they will returni read one article saying samsung working on new removable battery method that can even let the ip68 in phonesthis method is  removing the battery like removing the sim card with sim rejection toolfrom the topi like the idea
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Geometry Dash Xtoria;i with they wouldve made that camera section vertical better looking and better placement of the fingerprint scanner
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;too bad removable battery phones are never coming back lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pelle;smartphones have been made for many years now and they have made sure it wont burn this time its a good phone for sure top of the line im getting one and i wont regret it and battery will be good enough to at least last me a day using it a lot maybe not watching videos all the time or recording or having camera on im gonna have fun with this phone for years to come enjoy your coming shitty shit phones bye
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Devin;david m√∂rling i prefer my note 4 removable battery no curved screen not too tall not too wide just wish it had the specs of the 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jarookie;david m√∂rling i think its too edgy in my opinion the s8s8 looks much better  them cameras tho xd
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kuen Lee;i dun think its the same as the one in lg but i hate the one in lg cos it warp the corners i saw some photos taken with the note 8 wide angle its more like a 169 ratio wide angle which is nice and normal
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;the legend34 how is it a failure
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;anique zafar is using an update version of samsung experience and they did say they were working on the lag issue
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;youre not a samsung note user so you wouldnt know the importance of the phone at all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aaqib Bora;johnmade69 never said its a bad phone it doesnt offer anything new 95 percent of these features i can already get it on the s8s8 plus with a cheaper price tag the essential phone will be the iphone of android if it just give those timely software updates
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;aaqib bora the essential phone has nothing interestingsamsung has more things than the essential and better specs too
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;aaqib bora it has a dual cameras with ois on both cameras and one wide angle and the other telephoto lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sean Placker;just like your comment
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnrealOG;like your grammar
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;ishaan unlimited like your face
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;kirito sao3;yeah but my point is people keep saying the note 8 is just an s8 with a stylus and keep down playing it but isnt that the point the notes take everything great about the s and add a couple more features and an s pen but people were expecting this complete overhaulthat the s9 is rumored to get cuz its a modular phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JustinianXLIII;note 4 had qhd evolved cameras and metal frame note 5 had 4 gb of ram and started the trend of ergonomic curves note 7 had hdr display iris scanner usbc note 8 brings dual camera system and all the notes came with awesome  software features that helped in productivity
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Altandush Hoffmann;d13h4rd2l1v3 yeah but the display on the note 8 the best display
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mihin Waidyasekere;kirito sao3 nope this time this baby have awsome dual camera system
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnrealOG;tanzim k which further proves my point
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D13H4RD2L1V3;tanzim k unless youve got the s5 ltea which also has a qhd display
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tanzim K;unrealog you forgot the difference between the s5 and the note 4 the note 4 has a qhd 1440p display
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;HyperGamers - Games and Tech;dual camera s pen more ram  my favourite feature is the s pen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnrealOG;yeah sure note 3s4 with 4k camera s pen usb 30 and 3gb of ram note 4s5 with s pen 3gb of ram more internal storage metal frame note 5s6 with curved back s pen and more ram note 7s7 with s pen usb c new color hdr display iris scanner note 8s8 with s pen more ram dual cameras and android 711  no you dont get it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shawn Jones;pretty sure the note hardware is slightly better but most phone kids have no clue about important shit like speed and memory and display
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt 958;kirito sao3 iphone 4sdecent iphone 5bigger iphone 4 with different design iphone 5siphone 5 with fingerprint scanner iphone 6just different design iphone 6sagain the same as 6 iphone 7again the same as iphone 6just different camera design iphone 7sonly dual camera added  now tell me which is better samsung or apple
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;kirito sao3;this is how its been for years the real innovation is in the s line up its just like iphone 6 and then the 6s 7 and 7s gosh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan;prashant vashisht truss bigger battery than the s line and removable battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mounorman;spoiler alert iphone 8 oled is from samsung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Altandush Hoffmann;huge bezels funny
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Giorat23;zayla larue there are  look lg oled tvs near samsung ones miles better lg start use the oled technology way before samsung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zayla Larue;giorat23 better oled nigga are u serious right now lgs amoled is not better than samsungs
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;- Immortalian -;and has a totally shit price over 1000‚Ç¨ no real user will pay this shit
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RocketFootball;giorat23 haha better oled samsung has had the best display for eight years nobody makes amoled better than them it isnt even controversial apple getting theirs from lg
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Giorat23;tyler eberhardt no dude do more research at least the iphone 8 display will be flat and with much better technology better oled pro motion 120htz true tone display etc
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tyler Eberhardt;giorat23 you say that but the iphone 8 has curved edges üòÇ what a dummy
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mounir Tetouani;giorat23 good luck lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Slippy Toad;its their fault for forcing it upon the user by trying to eliminate compatible third party remapping tools htcs squeeze is programmable and you can enhance it with an app and theyre ok with it and you can deactivate it sonys camera button doesnt stand in the way and is much more useful samsung should not try to force their stuff upon their users
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dita Anggraini;gosh me too i guess ill be waiting for next note
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zack Smith;rez1 hossain nope  but its awsm
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan;rez1 hossain it looks worse than the iph8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Slippy Toad;nah the back is really ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;OUTSID3R;aren‚Äôt you too poor to afford a phone indian
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Cook;telephoto is far more useful than monochrome and wideangle they literally cannot fit in a larger battery because of how much tech is crammed inside the phone have you seen the inside of a samsung phone they have the most advanced battery density of any manufacturer
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D13H4RD2L1V3;benjamin sletten it‚Äôs not wideangle it‚Äôs a standard angle in relation to what many flagships have it‚Äôs called that in order to differentiate it from the zoom module  i have one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Benjamin Sletten;they have a wide angel and telefoto lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SprayArtist;itbankrock i did not know that thanks for clearing that up
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dude Lmao;techlinehd dual cameras seem to be a divisive thing same with fingerprint sensors  you can only get one of each common type being monochrome telephoto and wide angle mode each has upsides and the more divisive downsides hurts more especially when theres a dual camera setup on a phone youd otherwise consider perfect
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Itbankrock;ly spray art the wide angle lens is the lens with regular fov similar to the s8 its not the same wide angle lens lg implemented on the g6g5v20 basically its the same setup as the iphone 7 because samsung is being samsung
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SprayArtist;they included a wide angle lens and a telephoto lens instead of a regular lens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RaVee Shankar C;techlinehd oww good day brother  nice reviews
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;D13H4RD2L1V3;i still wish theyd gone with monochrome  the zoom implementation just seems a bit too metoo
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kuen Lee;dont really like the fisheye effect of the wide angle in g6
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ÃÅ.;techlinehd i was hoping for a monochrome sensor
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hasan Al-habbobi;itbankrock  i recall hearing that samsung does have wide angle lens if i am not mistaken but i think i know what you meanthe wideangle lens isnt wideangle like the lg g6 instead its a conventional camera like the camera of the s8 regardless though i still think its an improvement from what already exists on the market since its the first phone to feature two 12megapixel rear cameras with optical image stabilization on both the wideangle and telephoto lensesin addition to many other features
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TechLineHD;itbankrock exactly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TechLineHD;hasan alhabbobi wide angle like lg did with the g6
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TechLineHD;shawn tanner wide aperture and wide angle lens are completely different things jesus
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TechLineHD;the legend34 do you even know what wide angle camera is lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;derekisthematrix;depends on what your most common photo subject is for me and lots of parents taking closer shots of your kids with telephoto would be great grab the lg g6 if you need wide angle
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Itbankrock;hasan alhabbobi if you listened to michael its not the wide angle lens that you can see on lg phones today
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;The Legend34;techlinehd they did  did you even watch the event
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shawn Tanner;swae lee they said in the presentation that there is a wide angle camera and a telephoto wide angle being the 17 aperture and the telephoto being the 26 aperture
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MarkyMarq;cd27 üòÇüòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shawn Jones;richy calculus u buy a new one for 99 cents on ebay it also doesnt get used cause its useless so it stays locked in the phone and it tells u when its out
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CD27;krystal myth  what  replacing an spen cost like 15  i dont know about you but that is cheap for me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;they arent cheap to replace
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CD27;richy calculus  why
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xarc Factor;outsid3r depends on what you get
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;OUTSID3R;a decent car for 1 grand you‚Äôre underestimating the value of cars
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;nothing new about that its always been that way you poor peasant
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kyle Rego;senpaix but the iphone 7 costs the same as the 6s when it was released
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sma Das;ricky sekhon blown up
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;yamin huang;agree boring phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RICKY SEKHON;slender man just wait and watch billion years gonna end in september üòÇ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tomi Zelenc Kuma;slender man same processor and s8 plus looks better than this also anyone whos willing to pay over a thousand dollars for this over an s8 or s8 plus must be either retarded or very rich
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt 958;senpaix they want understand they r ifags they sold their brains to apple to get a discount on iphones
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt 958;ricky sekhon s8 with 6 gb ram dual camera s pen facilities a faster processor bigger display n not forgeting the stunning body design something apple cant give u in a billion years
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SenpaiX;u must be more retarded what difference between iphone 6s and 7  stupid  also dual camera  and forcetouch nothing more nothing better idiot   also s8 not have dual camera and 6 ram will improve battery   and speed  so dont be brainless
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tomi Zelenc Kuma;senpaix are you retarded or what most of the things you mentioned are already in the s8 series and wow 6 gigs of ram what an improvement who gives a fuck about ram if it would be perfectly fine with 4gigs too also the fingerprint scanner is almost at the same location and the display is the same in every waysso yes its an s8 plus with spen and dual cameras
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SenpaiX;hello blind person so   stylus  better screen   6 ram  forcetouch  improved software   dual camera  and improved place for fingerprint sensor far from camera isnt better and also the difference between note versions and s  never was so big                           s9 will be more differnet than s8 than iphone 7 to iphone 8 thats for sure
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Cook;what makes a note phone a note the spen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mamo;dnel not pandering he does a great job
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dnel;thanks for the pandering
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;DanielXD;adam b yes i noticed that too
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dnel;note 9 will be the first sammy with onscreen fingerprint
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dnel;you want some custard with that jelly scrolling
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;i dont know what youre smoking but lg phones have terrible battery life
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Altandush Hoffmann;mobiledecay yeah but the problem was not the size but how the battery manufacturer built the battery so it malfunctioned i guess samsung just went for the safest route
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;dan cook especially when the 7 exploded that battery was huge ü§§
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ShintaroGaming;meh my note 5 still lasts me the day  but i think best battery life so far goes to lg g6
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;dnel;the other notes had smaller screens
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Cook;this is the largest battery of any note yet except the 7
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dan Cook;with that logic the note 5 and 7 were s6 and s7s with spens whats your point
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CD27;mlfez  true
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;boneless pizza  you have a picture of logan poul or whatever his name is you have no right to even comment here lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Boneless Pizza;jay s i would try to argue your points but your comments are so incoherent and toxic that id be wasting my time
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ryanchavez111;sisir360  thelonegun101 this was mentioned but people shot back with samsung was able to make an extra port and still make it waterproof what no one seems to realize is the fact that the method samsung uses to waterproof which is encasing the internals effectively waterproofing the inside is highly protected and patented the only way apple can possibly make a phone waterproof is to seal it from the outside and while its possible to seal a speaker port and charging port a giant 35 mm headphone jack is basically a hole in the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;sisir360 || TheLoneGun101;mobiledecay surprised nobody here was able to answer this so far but to answer your question the removal of the headphone jack cleared up space to waterproof the phone better hence the ip67 rating and for a larger taptic engine before you go on about how the taptic engine is a minorunnecessary feature use it it makes regular vibrations feel boring
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;mobiledecay check the original iphone and compare it with the future iphone 8 i cant even name all the features
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;mobiledecay  stand out  i dont understand your question if youre asking about the iphone its much faster better processing power better ram optimization better camerapreference if you like shitty saturated images that look like they have a filter on than the s8 is better better app store more optimized ios with far less bugs and 10 times more updates and echo system compatible far more with all other apple products and better built guiltydoesnt fucking crack on the back as some one who had used the s7pixel and the iphone 7 plus i can tell you i would pick the pixel xl and iphone anytime
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;jay s what feature did they add you cant answer that obviously
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;rebornchiekogaming i dont give a fuck its because theyre all ignorant dickheads trying to ride a someone elses dick i would rather have no jack than a shitty touch id placement i use my id on my iphone and pixel at least 1000 times a day i would lose my shit if i had to correct myself  every time i misplace my finger
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Theo Baur;thats coz iphone was never a contender in the first place
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;RebornChiekoGaming;how many times do you access the internet of course many did complain about the absence of the headphone jack than the placement of the fingerprint scannerignorant fucktard
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;obvious_humor;prem kumar a fingerprint scanner and a headphone jack are two fundamentally different types of features
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;mobiledecay i own a pixel xl you fucking idiot lol ok inspector gadget why would you want a feature that you dont need you can fit a bigger battery in there instead i would rather have really good features that i use on the regular than a phone full of thousands of half ass features
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;jay s that is not the answer to my question thats just isheepery how is the lack of a feature a great future sounds like you have a tim cook blow up doll you sleep with every day
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;mobiledecay have you ever seen the internals of any iphone going from the 5 and up its one of the most compact internals ever everything is beautifully stacked together its amazing its one of the reasons why all flagships of today have amazing internals going without the jack is the future youre just going to see it more i doubt that any flagship of the future 3 years will still have a headphone jack
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;jay s a lot of space for what air
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jay S.;removal of the headphone jack clears out a lot of space and you can still use a 35 mm port just add in the adapter on it plus most people use wireless headphones this on the other hand cant be fixed its on there for good its sort of like a design flaw or at least i consider it to be
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ryanchavez111;prem kumar i know people who have hated the idea of no headphone jack but when they actually got the phone they loved it but i also know people who got the s8 and s8 who have traded it simply because it is increasingly annoying to simply unlock their phone while the removal of the audio jack is an annoyance not being able to unlock your phone is by far the worse of the two evils
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ffghhhhhhh;prem kumar whats worst no internet or slow internet
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Muse M;prem kumar dont worry let see how will note 8 fare market share next quarter or iphone 8 predict to be immersively popular
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Muse M;slender man true ios good point is no fancy ui like material design straightforward and be simple i used android for years and like most it expert we just as to get thing done without issues mnc love iphone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;GT 350R;rixtertube what is it useful for what can you do with it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;can you fags at least be creative with your outdated jokes
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;areeb1296;omg look a 2016 joke very funny xddddddd
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Saktuscactus;pht can you not
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];i asked specifically if it was safety concerns that motivated this smaller battery and samsung denied it they say it was a combination of dualcameradualois and s pen horning in on internal volume
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;djJames;mounir tetouani well nobody cares about the note 8 its worse than the v30 and i think people out there care about the v30 by giving lg another chance to be successful
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Omar Ben Sassi;jason thiner boring s8 your comment is boring
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jason Thiner;so the note 8 is just a bigger boring s8 then but much higher price tag
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;nobody will ask you about your v30 since its just a bigger boring looking g6 lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;that phone automatically failed after lg decided to ditch the secondary ticker
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mounir Tetouani;hadi abdul too you maybe but not meüòâ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JustinianXLIII;krystal myth moron im not following any school of fish i use the spen if i wanted just a big phone there are options everywhere its either note or nope currently running note 5 lg v30 is nowhere in my list go get it could care less
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;iBluairJgR;all the v20 did for me was confirm that the samsung galaxy series is truly top of the line when it comes to premium android phones i am hoping the google pixel can improve leaps and bounds to compete as king of the android market  the second screen is a nice idea but does not work well in action also its silly to see the second screen blackened out yet still on when watching videos  swapping batteries is nice however less than a year after my purchase  i cant get more than 4 hours out of the thing i am constantly switching batteries and the phone is hot on a consistent basis  even after turning on battery saver and limiting functions such as autosync and location  did not age well at all terrible phone in my opinion and being lgs answer to the note 7 at the time it doesnt even come close  september 15th cannot come quick enough
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ihave Noname;these ppl surely never use note phone before lol and some did use but maybe dont know all the feature abt note phone u all idiot dont know how many feature and how useless is note phone lmao idiot

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CreativeName;antidinos this is a hands on look not a review he is taking a look at samsungs new phone the note 8 when the phone releases he will give more opinions on the batterycameraetc what a review should have

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];please
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TheMusketITuckedIt;first phone ever with dual rear ois cameras how bout dat
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;maxim jonson nice try lol but those questions are shit ask questions such as is the performance better will it have a good battery life even though the capacity is smaller there ya go better questions that can discredit the phone better you ignorant fool
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;maxim jonson yes not really yes yes there you go your questions are answered ask better questions
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;matthew fernandez ignore him he just asks ignorant questions to try to find something bad on this phone he just looks at the price and not the review
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;maxim jonson bruh the advert says ois on the front and back jeez
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;maxim jonson shit and stupid questions fail
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;maxim jonson go to there website and your questions will be answered
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;its a form of mind control technique putting a market into a trance by having you focus on something while thinking of something else so you arent in control of your own thought look here think there no no back here now there you go etc
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;real questions im sure hed have answered if he was allowed to dont think hes even allowed to say hes not ive always been frustrated how speakers are often not seen as a main feature but ndas go through the trouble of specifically stating they shouldnt be mentioned because they know its important but have convinced people its not something to think about people wont go up in arms about what they dont know telling people its mono when they didnt even ask may suddenly make them realize they actually care about stereo but if you dont mention it then its not something of a focus theyre doing this with the headphone jacks on a lot of phones hiding side and bottom top profiles to the last minute etc
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Slippy Toad;maybe but i have my doubts  probably as good as every other samsung mono so its alright but nothing great  99 yes since s8 has it too  unless youre really after the spen most likely not
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Edgar Wagt;pepe maybe probably not yes no
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;creative planet;pepe every phone has that  its software will probably start lagging like after 5 months just like my frnds note 5 which he hates so much   all the blaming is on me coz i asked him to buy it for a really nice 256 price new
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pepe;probably  yes  yes  yes top of the line hard and software
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Prashanth Murali;only if you rub it hard enough

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jarookie;i could be wrong but it seems to be even more to the right than on the s8s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;CD27;novadoll  well i think i got what you are trying to say  and no iris scanner works off of infrared it works best in complete darkness and works worse the brigter the environment well obviously it will be in front of your eyes all the time so it is safe to say the it works all the time which it does

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jimmy Gunawan;cade del rey well if you say so i do not care go and take mirror selfie ü§≥ and show the world the ugliness of samsung back no case can hide that ugly camera
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cade Del Rey;jimmy gunawan lol the galaxy s6 s7 and s8 along with their plus and edge variants are the most beautiful phones ever front and back period along with the note 5 and 7 the note 8 is the first ugly samsung phone on the back in years
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jimmy Gunawan;audie liem samsung back is always fugly never improved iphone back is always gorgeous
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Muse M;papidimmi we see most of the time i forgot how it feel except we know we dont see the corner of the screen mean waste energy note 8 is like a land rover would you choose it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Muse M;audie liem true consumers dont understand why note 8 is so similar to xiaomi mix that is ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Crazcompart;shawn orjiakor  more powerful too  now that ive seen that the n8 is more a glorified s8 geared at stealing away potential iphone buyers there is however the upcoming lg v30 huawei  mate 10 pixel 22xl  and of course the iphone 8 itself
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;alvinston stephen;i agree with you  maybe its just on our eyes  it is ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cade Del Rey;that camera modulefingerprint sensorshealth sensor cluster is really ugly
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;BJ Mendez;i think its more gorgeous than before
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Son Goli;ive still havent seen a bezeless phone theres always gonna be a chin or 2

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ionut Daniel Serban;so mi6 honor 8 and 9 g6 mate 9 htc u 11 have ugly backs i think u need to visit the eye doctor
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;David hunsinger;hamza bajwa no its not lol
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];bahahaaaa  nice
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cory Ciuca;orbite  edits yeah and think about this when you buy a car you can buy a cheap car that still does its job its not the best in the business but it gets you places if you want a luxury car you will pay top dollar for it its like this phone its top of the line for smartphones and if you want it you will pay the high price if not you can get a different phone or a midrange phone that still does its job
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Orbite - Edits;ian hawkes im not saying theyre not expensive but its for a reason these 2 phones will be the best phones on the market for a while it would make sense for samsung and apple to milk as much money as possible
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Ian Hawkes;all you people are retarded note 8 is to expensive for what it is and also iphone 8 when it comes out get a god damn oneplus5
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tsai ing wen support CCP;same shit
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dark007 -;danny aston ios is very optimized along with all apps since you need 2 follow certain guidelines too upload an apps to the appstore while google play you can upload anything and load it with hundreds ads like 80 of apps on google play are thats why i switched 2 apple all my important stuff is done on my pc anyway
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Dark007 -;nathan  csgo how about the pressure sensitive back button
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cory Ciuca;zach dubos i dropped it and nothing happened my friend has shattered his iphone 7 twice and one time it was only about 3ft from the ground
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zach Dubos;cory ciuca it might not be stronger but it isn‚Äôt curved down the edges you can shatter your phone dropping it on its side
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cory Ciuca;almighty satan im guessing you have no friends
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Orbite - Edits;steal lmao apple didnt invent dual cameras also the samsungs have no camera bump while iphones have one of the biggest
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Blake Jordan;alosius antony samsung stole apples camera plus i cant buy an android because im not black or mexican
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Orbite - Edits;the camera on the note8 is just better overall you can clearly tell
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;TessellatedGuy;except that dual camera setup is way better than the 7 plus due to ois on both lenses
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Eric N;giorat23  and dont forget those huge bezels on the 7 plus to go along with the huge chasis holding that massive 55 display now thats engineering at its finest lmao
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Qalif Z;apple lovers dont even bother to watch your comment lmao
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Cory Ciuca;pancake lord fast charging samsung has it optimization only goes so far with a small battery that why the s8 beat the iphone 8 in a battery test
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pancake Lord;audio is absolute crap on s7 so you better not bring that to the table camera tons of comparisons on the internet decide it for yourself battery well the well optimized os consumes battery less winkwink screen oleds are burning out and thats a problem ask any phone technician

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Leon Camero;son goli its actually smaller to the hands than you think
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;oussema trabelsi;jonuthunt well im not gonna buy it i in general dont buy expensive android phones because they get pretty outdated pretty fast and are a waste of money the only expensive flagships that i owned which are the galaxy s6edge and before that the s3 were gifts from my fathers but i personally refuse to buy a 700 dollar phone that gets laggy and doesnt have any update after 2 years the note 8 is the pinnacle of what i hate about android phones
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jonuthunt;its useless until you buy it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;son goli not really retarded s8 is the same height as the s7 edge just with more screen and curved edges to add to those inches
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Son Goli;s8 and s8 grew too tall they shouldve been 55 and 57 not fucking retarded ass 58 and 61

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mr. Cat;this phone is shit i will never buy a samsung phone until it will cook me a breakfast
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;my question is what are yall expecting from a new phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Quan Chi & The Zero Issue Boys;badr beyari this phone is tony stark back when he was drinking
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Badr Beyari;hafssiii but you know what i mean though üòÖ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;hafssiii;not even close
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Abin Benny;rohan ramkumar what if some rich guy wants the s pen  functionality and pocket ability
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;AdamIsTalking;genuine question have you ever used the galaxy s8 that also has a huge screen size but because of a how small the bezels are and b the phones aspect ratio it really isnt any harder to handle than something like a plusmodel iphone or even a little smaller it will be trickier to handle to an extent because thats the tradeoff with a phone like this but i dont actually think it will be that awful to use
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rohan Ramkumar;abin benny note was always about being mammoth else get the s8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];telephoto
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;hafssiii;cheaper lol keep dreaming man v
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;daviddaaannggg;agreed its sooo ugly such a configuration would have looked waaay better in a vertical alignment imo to me corner cameras should have horizonal alignment middle cameras should have vertical it appears this year the note 8 and iphone 8 are both going against that
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ImNotGoodAtThis;bryan prime honestly i like the bar on the back while its not like id go out and buy it just because of that bar but im saying that i dont see a problem with it in the design it adds some contrast and honestly to me looks fine it sets it aside from other phone backs
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ShintaroGaming;ea i would rather stick with my note 5
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matthew Rine;on the contrary i think it looks much better than the individual bubbles previous samsung phones used
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;iAnasMD;y√∂k
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;alvinston stephen;the back are so ugly  g6  is pretty  but to me nokia 8 somehow catch my attention
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;i chose an lg g6no regrets at all
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;m1k3y c;tuƒürul kƒ±lƒ±√ß thats why we have choices to choose
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;agreed looks like a 2 year old drew it with crayonsjust no real symmetry especially on the backone of the ugliest backs ive seen in quite awhile
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;creative planet the pen takes up space and yall are making a big deal out of its battery size if you watch s8 3000mah battery vs s8 plus 3500mah battery the s8 plus only beat the s8 by 7 percent i already know the note has a slightly bigger screen but being a more optimized phone can get you far for one they optimiz3d the note 8 more to deal with they shit they stuffed in the phone i feel they are slowly forming they own os
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;tuƒürul kƒ±lƒ±√ß its not ugly to the point i wouldnt get it still a sexy phone but s8s8 i love more in terms of sexiness
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kyle Netherwood;its the dual cameras
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pap√≠Dimmi;feel  look
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;XzRaiderzX;gold looks ok the other ones are kind of meh
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Jarookie;i think the s8s8 looks better in my opinion the rounded corners of the screen doesnt match well with the more edgy look of the note 8 and the cameras are looking kinda weird to me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Moazam Ali;fuck da shape man this type of shape is so common even better than this but f they could provide a more sturdy phone along with d beautiful shape nd provide 32 bit audio jack atleast nd a better arrangement for da scanner and wide anglemuch much useful nd side dual speakers nd more things like dat it wod have been better
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;mena;tuƒürul kƒ±lƒ±√ß the note 8  looks fucking beautiful and thousands times nicer than the iphone 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;harryfizzy;creative planet you could tag along with a small car battery if you feel so bad about 3300 mah of power storage
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;harryfizzy;hey for all ya its ugly guys even my 3 year old son without being prompted noted that the note 8 is gorgeous  so what yall bitching this is a beautiful phone imho
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;NewPScity;i disagree it looks beautiful i love good looking technology
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Moazam Ali;it do dat even mr mobile is so down reviewing it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Prashanth Murali;yeah its boxy and no where near the s8 in terms of design but the s series is what theyre focusing on now
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;pisse3000;tuƒürul kƒ±lƒ±√ß i think it looks professional as fuck i‚Äôm in love with that camera module 3
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Khoa Tran;tuƒürul kƒ±lƒ±√ß dont know about that but its look pretty nice  compared to many phone out there
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;leri jiso so you never care if a phone has maybe an sd card slot or a decent battery or a fingerprint scanner all that matters to you is looks even if the phone is a steaming pile of featureless shit üòï
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MobileDecay;i normally buy a phone for features not just its looks although a gorgeous phone is a nice extra
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shellyman Vol.2;zach cline hell yes
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Crazcompart;mo101epic  or maybe an lg v30 when it arrives
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SDav21;mo101epic or just the v30 when it comes out
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Gabriel Sosa;tony dinh lol well thats an opinion
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Nitelynx96;jonjoe89 agreed i buy a phone because of looks and power
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Tony Dinh;mo101epic pixiel is fucking ugly what are you talking about
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Zach Cline;shellyman vol2 hell  no
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Big Boss;waiting for iphone 8 for me this will be interesting fight
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Pety;i agree that thats kind of ugly but thats a terrible reason to dismiss it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;jonjoe89;its not ugly at all lol and plus you should be buying a smartphone because its the smartest smartphone available not because of its looks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;JH.13;mo101epic i dont see how you give up on the phone when theres a black variant which completely hides the camerasfingerprint portion of the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Leri Jiso;madsupra354 whats wrong with that
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];to be fair that also would have necessitated an even smaller battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;MadSupra354;declining a phone because of its looks
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;maman89;mo101epic quite disappointing really my gripe with samsung this year is i wish they have refined their phone ever so slightly few minors flaws which adds up annoys the hell out of me wish i could overlook it but with these price point heck no
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shellyman Vol.2;or even the lg v30
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;slanahesh;i know right did no one at samsung even consider rotating the whole camerasensor arrangemnt clockwise by 90 degrees at least then everything would be centered and could maybe look nice
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shawn Orjiakor;caskz vdz yeah youre right on that regard but there are different alternatives for popular brands you dont need to buy something what others are buying buy what you like
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Nech Pech;it was today officially
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;theSyd;frizz what does that even mean it‚Äôs an almost 1000 phone it would be scandalous if it didn‚Äôt have a fingerprint reader nothing to ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù we are not in 2012
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;2SidedTech;i wish the fingerprint sensor was on the powerunlock button like sony phones
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Alpha Gamer;same lol whats wrong wiht it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rich Brown;john doe  whats wrong with that spot for it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Rich Brown;nathan dem where should it go and why
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;[T]OnySi G.;that is placed there to probably the only or best way to add fingerprint scanner because battery takes up most of the back of the phone¬† theres a reason these were made by engineers and not some youtube commenter
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Denny Nugraha;vincent too pickynever be a buyer and keep on spreading their opinion while the user are just finr and happy
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vincent;i have the s8 honestly it seems bad at first but you get used to it and its kinda nice people who unnecessarily criticize it without ever using it are just wayyyy too picky
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnrealOG;its like that because that was the most efficient way to organize internals
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Nitelynx96;i love how you people only complain about the fingerprint sensor placement and you wont buy the phone just because of that reason
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;off colored;nathan dem it actually works perfectly if youre left handed
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ThatGTAFan720;nathan dem on the galaxy s9
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;robert lee;nathan dem  i am leftieit works fine with me
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Danny Aston;i dont own an s8 because the position of the fingerprint sensor is a deal breaker the facial recognition and the iris scanner are very inconvenient to use unless they make them work from wider angles and faster and securely for the facial recognition so id rely on the fingerprint senor which funny enough its very inconvenient since it is placed so high and awkwardly out there
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kong Choksap;hasan alhabbobi sadly for someone who wear glasses like me iris scanner is a real pain in the ass sometime
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Katzelle3;hasan alhabbobi  its arguably safer than fingerprint since fingerprints are fairly easy to replicate however i guess the inconvenience comes with using your phone as a digital wallet  you can authorize your payments using biometrics with an iris sensor you have to look at your phone to authorize a payment while with fingerprint sensing you only put your finger on the sensor while pulling it out of your pocket
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Big Boss;samsung is not listening to feedback apparently
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;because they were having troubles with the build into the display finger print sensor causing the display to have white balancing issuesbrain memoryuse it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Safwan M;nathan dem i think they still havent figured out how to embed the scanner under the screen
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;WGACA;iam paras but non have all ways of unlocking
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;WGACA;iam paras just like apple removing the headphone jack and now the fingerprint scanner
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Harrybo;they cant change the design language in this generation itll likely be changed in the next one
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mike Hamilton;they gotta sell note 9 too now with a better placed fingerprint sensor and larger battery
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Andy Turfer;i agree the biggest advantage i find with the s8 is vr plug it in to a headset and youre transported to some offcolony hellhole on the edge of the galaxy battling space pirates whats not to like  i have the exynos model which is very snappy and responsive not sure what the snapdragon model is like
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Vincent;i have the s8 honestly it seems bad at first but you get used to it and its kinda nice people who unnecessarily criticize it without ever using it are just wayyyy too picky
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;UnrealOG;the iphone 8 most likely wont have a fingerprint scanner
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Nitelynx96;you tf even uses the fingerprint sensor i always use iris scanner or just put in my password
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;johnmade69;yall complain about everything
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Hasan Al-habbobi;atw tech  alpha r2 1not everyone found it terrible 2 iris scanner is much better faster more convenient and more secure than a finger print scanner  making your complaint about the finger print  scanner rather childish
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ATW Tech - Alpha R2;a c o m p l e x m a n gr8 b8 m8 r8 it 88
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;KiTTU RaO;atw tech  alpha r2 and it still having the rare 35mm hole at the chinüòÑüòÑüòÑ
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Kong Choksap;i own s8 and after using it for a while i actually like that placement a lots more than center back of the phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Aviral bajaj;yeah you wont be able to say that once the iphone comes out
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;A C o m p l e X M a N;atw tech  alpha r2 get a fucking life m8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;I love Androids, Dragons, and Wolves 1219;yall complaining when i reached that shit easy when i first used it on my aunts s8 but heysome people dont like it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Shobin Drogan;frizz what is samsung some kind of religion we need to appreciate lmao üòÇ fuck outta here
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;o k9;frizz wake up
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Riswan Ahmad P.;i could reach the sensor on my s8 without having to abnormally stretch my hands but identifying the sensor without using a case is still unnecessarily hard though
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Iam Paras;frizz every phone has a finger print scanner these days so dunno what kind of appreciation your talking bout
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;SavageArfad;anmol raj it won‚Äôt be hard for apple to beat this
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Niclas Holzke;1507krazy ok thats interesting to know i thought that because of the higher clockspeed and higher core count that snapdragon processors would be better
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;thedarkshadow;i temporarily switched to android to see if i would buy one but honestly its just the same experience packaged in two different ways anything i can do on my android i can do on my iphone the things i cant do are things i dont do on my phone
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;William The 3rd;anyone who believes that iphones are being crushed by any android in speed is just fanboying it up there are many videos that prove that is a lie lol nice try though
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;1507krazy;niclas holzke if you have any knowledge about soc design and architecture you wouldve actually known which one is betterapples a series chipsets are generation ahead of the snapdragonsapple uses a bigger die to improve performance and transistor count is almost twice than the snapdragon equivalent
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Niclas Holzke;danny aston the phones from apple are only faster because ios is their own operating system so they con optimize it better but if you would put a 835 snapdragon processor in an iphone it would maybe even more faster so i am not an iphone guy and i am still sticking to android phones but also i am not going to buy the note 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Sasa M;anmol raj allahu ekber
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;5TAT30FTH3ART;mihai lazar yeah they could do that but instead they are going to kill the competition btw whats wrong with 169
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mihai Lazar;iphone 8 is overhyped  apple knows that even if  they make another phone with 169 screen and normal bezels people would still buy it  apple is irrelevant  they are inferior so they must be exterminated  they will not succeed they will not prevail
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;5TAT30FTH3ART;this kind on comments proves that apple is still the king what has this video even to do with iphone wait until next month no one is going to look back to this note 8
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Danny Aston;lol no the iphone 8 will easily outperform this in every category the only thing samsung phones had going for them was the screen but it looks like that wont be the case anymore
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Matt 958;matt mcdonald apple wont do shit except steal ur money
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Giorat23;anmol raj üòÇüòÇ good joke
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Steve Park;blind prosopagnosiac have you taken the time to read actual facts if you had you would know that android phones only recently caught up with the iphone 7s performance with the use of snapdragon 835 processors i respect your opinions but use facts to back your opinions insted of blatantly lying
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Mr k;juan andr√©s suck it
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Juan Andr√©s;just wait for the iphone 8

SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;michael livote not what i meant but being burned would be more tolerable than having your hand blown off
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;ffs stop blazing no shit yet you got everybody saying i hope the note 8 doesnt explode
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;ffs stop blazing;xxtensive bs no shit sherlock
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Michael Livote;dude you say this like getting burned was all fine and dandylike it happens every daylol man you must be fun at parties
SamsungGalaxyNote8;MrMobile;Xxtensive BS;daniel maguire if the s8 didnt blow up what makes you think the note 8 will explode plus a note 7 never exploded batteries only smoked and caught fire exploding is releasing shockwaves of energy i havent seen anyone who had their hands blown off or anything  only suffered from burns

iPhoneX;MrMobile;F D;should i get iphone or samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;G-briell XD;nope
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike Lechner;you dont care for baseball i almost unsubscribed from your channel for that remark
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Langley;mostly im glad iphone users finally are getting things ive enjoyed for years with samsung phones like amazing oled screens higher res and wireless charging something that makes the pixel a no go for my next upgrade since they dont support that  of course they only get most of it in a 999 phone vs androids offering these things at various price points much cheaper  as far as the whole apple does things better than others not really at least not any more than any other company  every once in a while they hit that on something but then they miss on many other things or at least dont improve upon them  samsung has done this sort of thing forever  fast charging wireless charging wireless fast charging  oled screens from them each year pushing the bounds of screen quality  stylus support in a phone i mean a wacom digitizer and a stylus that can support 4k levels of sensitivity  the list goes on  other phone makers have their things too and if we go into software the list outside apple gets even bigger like multitasking  things android and its various skins did better and still do much better than ios  yet there still sits this perception that once every couple years apple gets one thing right and somehow that makes it their story  really their best talent is great marketing and realizing if you repeat self praise youll convince people its true  additionally though the face tracking stuff is interesting the tech behind it is not nearly as mind blowing as apple pitches it  nearly all the type of tech its using is behind the samsung iris scanner  the iphone x uses an ir camera ir illuminator basically a simple ir light projector and an ir dot projector not that different than the illuminator projecting dots is quite simple  the samsung has an ir camera  ir illuminator  so it just has one less ir projector thats it  it will be interesting to see how it performs in daylight for the same ir reasons you mentioned in your video though active tracking might help balance it  all those other sensors on the apple marketing are standard and have been on all smartphones forever  most manufacturers just dont over hype stuff quite that mundane but apple has no shame lol  in fact the s8 s8 and note 8 have it topped in total count they are the first phones to offer ambient light sensors on the front and back of the phone something key since your body can shade the sensor on the front and throw off the input a heart rate monitor pulse oximeter and of course on the note 8 we have a full wacom digitizer built in  unfortunately most people dont realize that the tech talked about is actually pretty mundane even if the application might be interesting  whats also interesting is the pc mmorpg everquest 2 supported face tracked avatars in their game since 2012 a whole 5 years ago it works quite well search youtube for soemote and only uses basic webcams no ir camerasprojectors needed  it makes a lot more sense for something like that where you are playing an avatar on a large screen  on a phone why not just use your actual face to talk with people rather than face track it onto poop lol  the facial recognition login is probably the best use for the tech and in the end it wont make a difference to most users if its a bit more secure than the ones other offers  if you really are worried about someone stealing your phone and they already have a high res picture of you to login to your phone well you have bigger problems lol and businesses have often still required pin codes even with biometrics on phones  the reality is you can change a pin or a password but you cant change your face or your fingerprint so someone simply needs to figure out how to fake it once and its done for  this is why in the moviesshows that use biometrics for super secret government facilities also require a passcode on top of them  its not about easy of use its about multiple layers  unfortunately many simply believe the apple marketing if they say this is the first oled screen good enough for an iphone then most of their users will believe it despite the fact samsung oleds have been beating iphone lcds for many years now including color accuracy many dont realize samsung phones have screen modes and the default one purposely increases the color space but you can set it to basic to have a very accurate srgb color space  in any case good video  it is good to see these things finally make it to iphones i genuinely am happy they are getting some of these excellent things that have worked quite well for years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Flo grown manny;i had the palm pre plus i loved the ui on that phone it was way ahead of its time

iPhoneX;MrMobile;AzuMentch36;your professional objectivity is really shining in this one in fact thanks to that i didnt know that palm was one of the first to have wireless charging on their phones in fact i thought it was nokia if not kyocera that did it first

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joseph Tossoukpe;hello i really loved the reference to webos which was for me the best mobile os of all time as you said many of the features we now see on our phones come from there and only a few tech people remember thanks for the video though

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar Cardenas;what a bunch of crapive using wireless charging for years to the envy of iphone users and it is already widely popular it would be decent from you to say what  you are forced to pay if you want to use features like fast or wireless charging

iPhoneX;MrMobile;John M Edmondson;oh and thanks michael for a great intro to the iphone x  easily the best ive seen yet must be that fellow star trek fan in you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John M Edmondson;hi michael as an android user currently a s8 i am really glad to see apple back in the game and still providing real competition for android as you rightly point out there is nothing truly original in what the iphone x offers but having diverted some much of their engineering and other staff for such a long time to this product there is little doubt that it will raise the bar in certain areas for its competitors and we all benefit from that so whether you are going to buy one or not be grateful for those that do because they make things better for all of us by inspiring the samsungs and the lgs and so forth to also raise the bar in kind and then we all benefit

iPhoneX;MrMobile;k2hsharpe;re your enthusiasm for gesture control your top of list feature that apple is improving if i swipe down from the top with 1 finger i get my most used onoff toggles for things such as wifi location bluetooth screen brightness etc plus my chosen notifications plus settings  two finger swipe down gives me access to the full 19 controls plus notifications plus settings  the order of these 19 controls are customisable if i swipe in from diagonally opposing corners it brings up my 3 home screens where i can add  delete home screens and access wallpapers widgets and my settings if i swipe in from the left i get access to the 2 edge screens i‚Äôve chosen ‚Äì 1 for 5 of my favourite contacts with notifications and 1 for 5 apps i‚Äôve chosen to place there like currency app calculator conversions app etc all these pretty standard i guess  but everything from now on i‚Äôve pretty much chosen what the action will do  ‚Ä¶ on my bottom task bar i‚Äôve placed my choice of 4 app icons for sms gmail contacts and phone app  plus an icon for the app drawer  touching the app drawer icon calls up my apps which i‚Äôve chosen to have scroll vertically   if i swipe up from the app drawer i open the settings for my launcher if i swipe up from the lower part of the screen with a single finger it calls up my ir universal remote control  at the moment i have it programmed for a samsung tv a yamaha av receiver and a panasonic bluray  pvr if i single finger swipe down from the upper part of the screen it opens up my news magazine  a 2 finger swipe down opens my torch a double tap on a home screen calls up and starts my sound recorder currently set to record in high quality wav files a single press to my home button takes me back to my last home screen  a double press calls up my camera  a triple press changes the screen to bw to conserve power thing is i‚Äôve had my last 2 phones programmed to do most of this and that‚Äôs over the past 4 and a half years  i seriously haven‚Äôt a clue why you think a few rudimentary swipe gestures is special enough to make it to your list of features you claim apple does better let alone number 1
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris Malaspinas;this is a step into future in my opinion every company is just trying to make their phones faster and better looking instead apple and i cant believe im saying this is looking forward by adding some touches defying what the world needs like right now

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;best iphone designs ever 1 55sse 2 44s 3 2g 4 x 5 7 6 8 7 66s 8 3g3gs 9 5c  i believe my space gray iphone se is the best iphone ever made insideout i still prefer the design of my glacial silver htc one m7 more but i prefer using my se way more but since i dont like that ios lacks launchers that i would only rank it among my 3 fav  favorites lg v20 lg g5 apple iphone se google pixel samsung galaxy s7 edge motorola moto e 4g  v20 moved up from 3 g5 went down to 2 v20 really is the better phone se moved up a couple spots because its so small and beautiful easy to carry pixel was 2 mostly and 1 at some point bland design no real standout features still love it but oreo kinda ruined it for me also has keyboard lag s7e and moto are interchangeable although i prefer motorola way more than samsung as a phone maker  when or if i get the x it will rank about 3 or 4 it will be my daily driver on tmobile once i cut ties with verizon to save money the iphone se will be the secondary next to it people use multiple phones and platforms i carried 23 phones since 2004 used ios android and windows phone simultaneously in 2011 whats the point of arguing their merits or a picking a side  work  ios home  recreation  android  work  iphone sex travel  iphone x w telephoto  lg v20 w wideangle  close to my smartphone nirvana the iphone x will likely be the last iphone i will buy this decade until samsung galaxy x foldable displays is released
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;i was thinking about just waiting for the successor to the iphone x because it likely adds the fingerprint scanner onto the display but what if face id is amazing already how often is halloween and comiccon anyway just turn it off people just doubting the tech since they never used it similar to how some were doubtful with touch id when 5s introduced it  getting iphone x in 2017 makes more sense to me than 2018 its the 10th year anniversary 2018 iphone x becomes the 11th anniversary that nobody celebrates that x is meant for 10 not 11 what would be cool is an iphone x product red black front and red back the x is the most special edition iphone since the se  haters can keep on hating i dont even like ios and prefer it had launchers to simplify the clutter on that boring static home screen i also dont like using itunes but you cant deny this x will be a success
iPhoneX;MrMobile;urceyes;even at demo the face id didnt work at first and prompted the pass code screen old tech apple as usual and the notch at the top is ridiculous when watching videophoto‚Ä¶
iPhoneX;MrMobile;enriceaux;the only new function on the iphone galaxy s8 is the face scanning and still people want to pay 1000 dollars for this shite i really dont know why apple is still this popular

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chung Kai Man;will there be a face id for the up coming mac
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lovella Recto;love those new features especially wireless charging camera and ar cant wait for more review on this phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;guylandry1992;i wouldnt buy this phone as theres no way i would spend enough money for a down payment on an average car for a phone and im still not into iphones even though i only use ipads and macs this phone may be late in tech but it is as it seems an improvement on the tech they are finally introducing whatever we may say about old tech and as crazy as i think it may be for the majority of people who will put themselves in debt just for this phone it will work out and people will love them whatever the reason may be it always works out not so well for the customers accounts but it just will the one thing i like is that we are closer to have an entirely bezelfree phone and i know they could have done it but theyll need it so they can make an s s plus and suck more money now im counting on android phone producers to come up with an entirely bezelfree phone within a year one that is all usable screen and even the speaker behind the screen with just a little space for sound
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jo's Gateway;so this video is basically to talk bout all the good things apple didnt do quite well and make them look good so that its 999 price tag could be justified meh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke Janzen;this was better than watching the keynote  you make great videos keep it up

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Adil Riyami;hahahah holy cook ü§£ü§£
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Micha≈Ç Adamczyk;sorry mrmobile but this time youre wrong apart from the fact that true adopting those features by apple will help them reach mass audiences they are not groundbreaking and not even better than other mobile makers features ‚Ä¢ the 60 fps 4k movies and the slomo  fine great but remember you cant stuck sd card into that phone and those movies tend to eat a lot of space and i mean  a lot people with 64 gigs wont be able to shoot many movies with it ‚Ä¢ ar  well erm yeah remember that awesome magic leap movie from about 2 years ago yeah ist still only a demo apart from the fact that its nothing new and innovative tech giants struggle to make use of augmented reality way to often its in your way when it comes to experiencing the world rather than enhancing the experience ‚Ä¢ gestures control  ok you can probably get used to it but is it more convenient better more intuitive very doubtful plus  you will really struggle to use your phone with one hand now ‚Ä¢ wireless charging  well duh ‚Ä¢ and finally  removing the touch id and putting facial recognition apple didnt want to do that its just a workaround because they were unable to place the fingerprint scanner under the screen having that in mind who can say that face recognition is better its not as convenient probably not as safe not as versatile as you will probably have troubles using it in some situations and they couldnt put in the iris scanner because that would be so obvious that they are copying from samsung come on now with all that in mind it is interesting and moving phone but is it really better innovative not really i believe
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ajay raj;considering your pointsvery well laid outbut ar tech is not complete with anybodyand as much as apple showed ar android showed that last yearand with wireless charging i think its a lame thing which is getting promotedits much more inconvenient than usefulemoji thingy is another gimmickif android made it most of the reviewers and users would have called it a gimmickand face id has its own limitationsstill like the iris scanner or the more conventional fingerprint scannernot at the position where samsung placed it its weird
iPhoneX;MrMobile;bensoflyyy;i get you about gestures i used the nokia n9 for half a year before and when i went back to android twas reallyy inconvenient for ne

iPhoneX;MrMobile;rakesh verma;most comprehensive video on iphone x great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;s10dlka;1 samsung et al introduces a feature 2 it becomes popular 3 apple adopts it and often improves upon it 4 it becomes mainstream  when you view it like that you can see why iphone fans and android fans shouldnt hate each other but be grateful for each other its a symbiotic rivalry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rz_Dragunov;face it people apple not always thee first but they always raise the bar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheTechSultan;so face id will prevent me from unlocking my phone in situations when i cant fully look at it for example when i drive and just want to unlock it while its on the dock to change a song or see a sms noooo i have to remove it look at it when i am driving and then interact with it  face id is cool and great tech but in so many cases its unconvinient  and the price dammm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sultanabran1;doesnt matter what apple does itll sell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;madtrexx;sorry mr mobile but you said so much crap in this video i cant handle it anymore unsub this phone is just lam faceid is lame  it been already tested it works even with a photo so its unsave and uselees ar nobody use it wireless charging nothing gonna change and who cares that apple is popular if ppl have already fe 500mln iphones  they all will not change them now to the x you said a totally bullshit in this video and it was one of the most unobjectiv videos ive seen on this channel slowmo who even use this few skate of surf fans some stupid youtubers slow down and go back to earth
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Terrance Richardson;great video keep up the good work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dorje Gyurme;the cut out at the top of the display and the tall skinny screen are dealbreakers for me the 8 plus‚Äôs 54inch display is smaller diagonally than the iphone x‚Äôs 58inch screen but because it has a¬†wider screen some content will actually look larger on the iphone 678 pluss than on the iphone x for now i will keep my jet black iphone 7plus 256gig and wait for the bezelless iphone xplus with 500 gigs storage

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;justine and michael fisher are about 34 im 36 so marques was only 14 when the og iphone was released and was 23 years old when sega saturn sony playstation and nintendo 64 were released  mkbhd probably doesnt know who oj simpson is and a sony walkman unless he googled it too young to remember michael jordans prime missed out on 80s cartoons and sitcoms never experienced having fun before the internet family guy 80s references flies right over his head  children of the 80s fuck were old üë¥üëµ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Holzer;excellent recap great video so stoked for iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;puckhead1221;apple needs to redo their notifications then ill switch to iphone from android their notifications seem as preschool as the locked down app grid

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tony Hedges;a video about the iphone x where the host is able to remain unmoved by applehype well done on being dispassionate without being boring easy for me to say but i appreciate how difficult a balance this is i wonder why you chose to shoehorn in the unnecessary bit about the apple watch it hasnt outwardly changed since it first came out i personally think that it looks awful i prefer my moto 360 2nd gen but thats personal opinion and a touch of classic style well done michael

iPhoneX;MrMobile;dessnom;not as iumprerssive as sonys 960 fps slomo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WINTERWOLF;apple is like nintendo using old but well known hardware instead of new experimental stuff most experimental stuff are gimmicks  but if experimental stuff gets more well known it can be improved
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MOHAMED ALTEGANI;i was planning to watch the keynote  but thanks to this video  i wont  awosme work mike

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sanu;1000well fuck you apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nate Adam;out of nowhere im looking into getting my first smartwatch and was wondering does android wear 20 give the option to setup without a smartphone or is the samsung gear s3 a better option
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WHOAITSTHEINTERNET;look im okay with the device its just the buzz around it that always bugs me people giving them credit as if they invented the technology but i will say they do improve tech i just dont think most people know that they use already existing tech
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alejandro Aguilar;new features lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MSi GS70 6QE;oh my god why those usa ppl are so stupid suddenly they started care  bcos iphone has it  god help them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hannu Tuunanen;my s8 is fine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tom Liu;instead of using wireless charging or some new charging tricks how about create a battery that can last at least a week battery is always the weakness of any smartphone without power the 1000 phone is nothing but a piece of junk so how about give user a bigger and battery
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Adam;government hey apple we need everyones fingerprints apple no problemo  government thanks for the fingerprints now lets get those faces that match the fingerprints  apple snm consider it done you government cronies
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike Ivsin;why copy apple vid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DƒÉnu»õ Florian;i came here looking for an honest opinion left disappointed this is just an apple commercial
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shuip Sezairi;so hes not going to mention that the face id failed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GuuzakaTube;i love how he sophisticatedly exposes apple in this video üòÅ i bet he wanted to roast them for claiming to be so firsty about the features but refrained from doing so üòù
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Niroshan Chanaka;you are the best of them all mr  mobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pedro Gomez - Faccio;webos 3
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Stubbo 242;apple should have named this phone the iphone 7s7s and name the iphone x iphone pro im sure apple could have made the phones different by letting the 7s 8 8s utilize software buttons add a back and multi task key also drop the price by 100 dollars on the iphone pro and they would have won over customers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VenVileTV;this is the narrative here competitors clamour to compete with apple butyet these competitors have been releasing so many of these features 23 years ahead of apple tell me something mr mobile in your world tainted by your apple rosetainted glasses is there any possibility that apple may be the ones who feel as though they need to compete with the offerings from their competitors  of course not because its apple right give me a break i understand that youre from the usa and apple is the leading smartphone seller in the us i think but the rest of the world exists and samsung has held that number 1 spot for quite some time now closely followed by huawei guess what the rest of the world doesnt revolve around apple  maybe if you tech journalists took a minute to consider that thered be a bit more neutrality and balance of praise in this industry apple can do no wrong and even when theyre the last to do anything they might as well be the first to me something is wrong with that type of thinking and behaviour
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VenVileTV;why arent there any popular tech journalist brave enough to call it like it is and say that compared to what the competition is offering the iphone x is shitoverpriced shit  stop giving this company a pass for their mediocre latetothedance implementations theyre always 23 years behind and they get praised for it why because they do it the best no the only thing theyre doing great here is the faceid by their claims every single other thing theyve done has come late and is just as good as what the competition offers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jerad Berry;apples the most famous plagiarist but anyway good im glad apples actually bringing it this year maybe samsung will actually start trying again with their next note and galaxy again

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike M;iphones are just pure junk the 8 and 8 plus basically same old boring plain iphones the x is just pure copy of the essential phone apple still continuing to struggle to innovate of any of their own ideas and still cant catch up to other big brands
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;i beg to differ its not betting anything on its success apple gets a pass for everything it fails at so it doesnt matter as always everybody else gets held accountable even for things that work but not 110 perfection thats the sad world we live in when brands have such a cult level status

iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheCompassMaker;ive been wallowing in the antiapple circlejerk for a time that this reasonable take on the launch is quite refreshing the only thing though is on that face id tech they say that they poured research time and money but that remains to be seen i think siri was the last such apple endeavor but that took some work to become well refined

iPhoneX;MrMobile;WitnessG;im sure the faceid thing works pretty fast and reliably but theres no way its going to be better than a fingerprint sensor you can unlock the phone with a fingerprint sensor while youre still picking it up with the faceid you have to put it directly infront of you at the right angle to get your entire face most of the time when im using my phone its not facing parallel to my face its usually angled back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dmitriy Chaikovskiy;so pretty much iphone has nothing new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Cohen;listen to your sign off then do it again one more time dont want to kill yourself turn it up a lil how bout now ahhh there we go

iPhoneX;MrMobile;pixypolly;1149 for the shit i can already do with my android smartphone no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;piratesmvp;i cant believe that they were okay with a camera bump on the back im pretty sure steve jobs would never have liked that also face id takes too long to unlock the phone if they want people to start using that instead of a passcode it needs to be nearly instantaneous finally what if youre using your phone on the table and need to unlock it before you could use touch id to unlock now you will have to either use the passcode or pick up the phone to look at it and then set it down again i recommend waiting for the iphone xs

iPhoneX;MrMobile;ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ®ŸàÿØŸäŸÜ;that photo id and 3d is the most scariest for the year of 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wrathchicken;no thoughts1st impressions on animoji
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Gerrard;i know that you dont want to bash apple it is easy to do but really they are doing poorly their phones are way too expensive for what you get it seems like they remove features but increase the price at the same time no finger print scanner no headphone jack  please pay more i know apple help to push google and others but still they dont deserve the position they hold
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LouisvandeWetering;where is the headphone jack where can i put a memory card no way i am going to pay ‚Ç¨1000 for a phone without these features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;conlee22;this was a weird video usually you wait until you get to have your hands on a product before saying how good it is    and since weve already seen the face id fail and alot of other things have been done in other phones you seem like youre promoting the iphone x in this video just my thoughts not much sceptisism as there normally would be for a device thats yet to be used
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ganjabobby;this is the first iphone x video ive watched normally its always mkbhds first impressions video thats pops up in my suggestions  i just go with it but these days i really want to hear what mr mobile thinks about the latest tech release
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kevin H.;now that it has wireless charging expect the next iphone to not have a charging port
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Will Aird;at 335 on the note 8 where did you find that wallpaper
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;gestures are good for some actions on a phone but that app switching gesture they are using looks like it could get painful quickly  the faceid stuff is neat and all but that it failed at first during its first demo seems quite slow and has a floodlight which is nice but has very limited uses people unlock their phones when they arent putting them right in front of their faces which are all offputting things about it  lets face it they doubled down on faceid when it became clear that a beneathdisplay fingerprint reader was not going to happen with oled displays in time for the launch
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke et;ios 11 literally web os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qeryhii Dgusz;fail face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nerch Fritzsche;do the front cameras recognise depth what if you put a photo with the owners face will it unlock the phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anthony Hernandez;the note 8 is still better ¬†so the final is that the iphone x has barely caught up to samsung galaxy ¬†the display is the same as the note 4wow ¬†everything has been done ¬†so guess what the note 8 at 50 off which is better than the iphone x which will never have a discount
iPhoneX;MrMobile;w3apon3;you are so right about palm webos was the best os and years ahead of its time i sold my iphone 3g s cancelled my att contract and signed up with sprint to get that phone the financial troubles of palm and the exclusivity of sprint doomed the phone and os but like you said companies keep borrowing features to implement in their oss
iPhoneX;MrMobile;–ê–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–º;gotta love your honesty
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tinas Askus;ios 11 in samsung shell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tipoomaster;it may be the smallest lte smartwatch but three generations not extending that oled to edge to edge ehh the bezel looks dated with all the bezel shrinking going on in the rest of apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rokas Anonimas;this video should be called overpraising iphone x besides the 240 fps 1080p videos i did not see anything really interesting from iphone x it is a really good device but it is nothing special
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jonathan Pena;thanks for bringing the old memories of our forgotten palm webos software which was the best mobile os ever with its card and gestures
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tipoomaster;something about the combination of the oled screen in the demo area and the launchpad homescreen grid made the latter seem particularly dated idk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jorge Alicio Kaida;you wear lg warch sport everyday review please
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Som Harsh;durand people are crazy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TechSesh;really great video you really are mrmobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kramdens1967;with a fingerprint sensor my phone is unlocked before i even barely have it out of my pocket i think if everyone starts getting rid of those its a loselose not a winwin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;afromarco005;someone care to explain why apple is still relevant in late 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cyle Hendricks;one thing you all forget usually when apple does something they do it right facial scanner that has a one in a million chances of being fooled a fingerprint scanner that actually works their cameras back in the day were always 1 imessage  android has yet to develop something on par with it the apple watch can‚Äôt be matched by any other smart watch  that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 1 don‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôm not an apple sheep well maybe a little i do have a note8 which i love but since most people i know and family use iphone it makes the overall experience even more important
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar M.;best video that describes why what apple is doing is with iphone x is important kudos subscribed for this awesome insight
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Omar nieves;loving my fast wireless charging on note 8 enjoy your new revolutionary regular fast charging apple suck a dik
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Melvin Ray Spence III;does it still make calls ls it still a phone who the hell needs all these features this is the 10 year anniversary phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;poeglives;so face id is going to work better than it did at the event
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hussam El-khawaga;what about comparing the price with the new functions  features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lucas Borges;ho ho ho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;James Russo;are gestures faster than using a home key of some sort i dont think so in the same way that face unlock is slower than a fingerprint scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anas Safa;seriously bro how much did they pay for you to break the contract
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sebastian J;iphone x is not 10even tho x is the roman numeral for 10u shant skip 9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DavidFR;sidncifhfbcicifjrncciswowowsndidhrddij geekgasm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rishi Pahwa;fantastically shot review mr mobile such a joy to watch your review vids
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cory Wilson;the only thing new about phone is the price android already had these features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar Maradiaga;love how you said they arent the 1st to do many things we all know apple is always catching up to android and the reason many youtubers like yourself are on the latest android devices
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bryan S;mr mobile highlights exactly why apple has been so wack these past few years they dont innovate anymore as stated in the intro they take things that have been invented and applied in elsewhere and they make them better its as if they wait around for other companies to invent something or to come up with some clever software and then apples rd says how can we make it better how can we adapt it to the iphone theyre playing catchup now the iphone x is a beautifully designed phone but ios is still as boring as ever
iPhoneX;MrMobile;le iboy;how are you supposed to use ur phone when wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andy Rackley;its irrelevant what hardware apple brings the phone can still not be customized and looks absolutely the same as the original iphone its boring  michael did a great job with the review but as a note 8 user of one week now no way i would give it up for an iphone 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gustavo S√°enz;can someone tell me what are the differences between iphone 7 and 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SaNu BaiJulal;i love your videos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr2pint;apple increased the price of the ipad pro line straight after this event  go figure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;weedwak;replacing fingerprint with faceid was unbelievably stupid i mean google already tried it in 2011 and i use it on my phone today for when my phone is on a table or something and it didnt take off fingerprints are simply more convenient  i just hope other manufacturers dont follow this absolutely braindead stupid idea
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Twunk;i already found spending 600dollars on a phone too much 1 thousand dollars though come on peopleit‚Äôs not even available in rose gold anymorei‚Äôm sticking with my se
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VERSATILE KNOWLEDGE;next iphone is iphone k  k stands for your kidney  u need to sell it to buy it üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gareth Harris;great video mate quality of your content keeps getting better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fahad Abdul Samad;you forgot to mention about excellent nokia n9 which came with 100 gesture control had nokia stick to mego and develop it furthermay be things would have been different
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Naveen Raj;now after this launch i am really looking forward to the changes in  pixel next year will google be able to bring in a breakthrough mobile next year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ahmad Debian;ok two mores phone to go ¬†the pixel xl 2 and huawei mate 10 and i will be able to decide which phone will be the successor for my note 5so far my top choices are the¬†lg v30 and¬†htc u 11
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VeroMithril;now who steal your phone also steal your face
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Markec smotanec;i dont use iphone because i love android but i phone is the best when they relased somethinglike face idit will work 100  samsung not sowhen they do tech  they do it right that is apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wilson ndebay;the black bar should have gone through the top two ends but staying in the middle while the screen surrounds it is almost a distraction to me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mick Delaney;michael how can you call face id a win regardless when it failed to work during apples life unveiling of the phone fact is it will be gimmicky and will not work as consistantly or as accurately as a fingerprint scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Debra Dukes;absolutely gorgeous devices debüëç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cesar Alvarez;iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jimmy Song;i feel like apple ditched touch id because they want to cut the production cost i find it being really cheap on their part because theyre charging 10001100 but who knows they might bring it back with iphone xs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GamingLaw;innovation based old patents
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raveen Bikha;well its old features that exist on android but now the competition getting harder android get better optimization and ios more features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Scott M;what about when i want¬† to checklook at¬†my phone but not unlock it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A. B;hey apple fans how feels the samsung displays and full screen and samsung chip welcome to the club
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gguybr;dont that brow at the top disturb any of you especially  on video playing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NickL Leeto;excellent video michael thumbs up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;face id didnt even work at the presentationwhy not have iris scanning
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;whats the battery capacity on the iphone 10 2 hours longer than the iphone 7 what about iphone 8 and 8plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;is samsung supplying the oled displays for apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;where is the x pen
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TimDawg 919;apple remember the last company that decided to skip a model number note 7 no note 6 so you decide to jump over 9 and do x get out your fire extinguishers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;where is multi window
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bla≈æ Veber;two years too late remove the charging port that will be the first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Peter Armijo;1000 dollars still stuck on 3gb ram still stuck on a resolution of 2436√ó1125 thats bull shit nothing new here and no micro sd slot wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TimDawg 919;iphone x the x is for expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;321bluff;you are a samsung hater iam not surprised with the video
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hamaid Ahmed;i like the caption of the video new effin phone old features apples best recipe to feed its sheeple good vid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BattleExtremeNL;for that price i can buy 1 oneplus 5 1 nokia 3310 1 console  game and still have some change  this phone better whipe my ass and call me daddy for that price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;they put wireless charging so that they could ditch the lightning port next year so that you will have to use air pods or any other wireless headphones bastards i know they will do this if not in 2018 they will do it 2019 this is not an innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fabio Rigo;number 1 gestures  for real  thats the new thing   this is mr mobile channel right  video highly disappointing i wanted some meaningful insight not the second part of the apple marketing campaign  but do not fret everybody is uncritically gushing as you do you are in good company
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wascar G;damn am another video that i should not started watching because i cant stop watching once i start watching mr mobile doing reviews  introduction to a movie sort of a good one thats what it feels
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anand Ks;apple does things better instead of doing it first simple they are not good enough to things first they always want to copy and be more perfect with older things  mrmobile  you have been one reviewer ive always been waiting for thanks the honest review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ezeuzo1;you have slightly changed my perspective on the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tech Majid;no apple ditch touch id because of no space where they apply
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;iphone xs gesture controls is the single most underrated feature nobody is talking about except for the best tech reviewer ever mr mobile its webos reincarnated swipe up to close apps and carousel üé† to the next ones will feel awesome  toss in the fact that ios11 with drag  drop and file manager will be a bigger update for ios than oreo has been for android users i have oreo on my pixel and i barely notice any differences from nougat it feels a little worse for me  apple decided to use qii open standard charging benefits everyone including ones with android especially if you are hanging out at starbucks no proprietary bullshit it may not be the prettiest iphone ever and its xpensive but it still is the best iphone  ios update ever
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sean Turner;the palm pre was so ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anas Nazeer;so revolutionary im all wet down there revolutionary in stealing and copying and calling it theirs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Lindsay;the 60 fps is really cool but by ditching the touch id they really better make sure face id is flawless and judging by yesterdays applefest its far from it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kris S.;long live webos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Inajet Dzemoski;excellent review my friend classy as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Da Fuq;where is the iphone 9 lol apple pulled a m on us
iPhoneX;MrMobile;soulreplenished;definitely disagree with the idea that gestures are a good replacement for the home button specifically the fingerprint sensor to preserve the security value of the fingerprint sensor you have to make sure your face has to be within the cameras frame of view i can unlock my secured phone straight from my pocket just by pulling my out phone whilst my thumb is on the fingerprint home button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;zohaib javed;great review the best i ve seen yet
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Takuma Kawai;hey michael i completely agree with you about your opinion for the iphone x i have been an android user for all this time but still the iphone x seems so interesting and just cant wait to get my hands on it didnt show up on the video but one of my most curious technology in the new iphones is the auto wb thank you for your great videos and ill be looking forward for more peace
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Studio Glass Box;my car has qi wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tri spin;tyr
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Julian Summers;ill get the watch and maybe the 8but i aint paying no thousand dollars for one thingwhen that same thousand can bring 2 things economics my niggas
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nemo Lee;most new things are just gimmicks and for the other things we should say at the end it came to an iphone and that for such an heffty price no apple thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Zachary Batten;i think its funny how people say the faceid mess up was an actual mess up you have to enter your pass code once you turn on your device thats all that happened faceid did not fail i was sad they didnt mention that after it happened
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;if apple never named their iphones with an s and numbered it like air jordan shoes every year the iphone x would have been released last year now after releasing 14 different iphone models its confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9  this is what apple should have done without s naming  2007  iphone 2008  iphone ii instead of 3g 2009  iphone iii instead of 3gs 2010  iphone iv 2011  iphone v instead of 4s 2012  iphone vi instead of 5 2013  iphone vii instead of 5s 2014  iphone viii instead of 6 2015  iphone ix instead of 6s 2016  iphone x instead of 7 2017  iphone xi instead of 8  x  only the first iphone and iphone 4 were named properly poor iphone 9 and 7 doesnt get an s model next year remove the numerics and refer to it only as iphone the same way the numerics no longer exist for ipads or a macbook
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Saso Stoilevski;ok who can tell me how many times did they mention the word revolutionary on the presentation   if i heard that word from any company that many times i would start thinking that they made something worth listening jesus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Black Knight;a thousand us dollars i dont care how much time and money went into all those features they build the the thing for less than 300 theyll make back whatever they spent on rd and much more profit if they sell it for 700 which is already a super premium flagship price the things you can get for a thousand us dollars
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spencer Crawley Jr;man oh man do i miss webos im with you mrmobile sentimental or not it did things that just worked that ios and android are still figuring out alas the show must go on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert McCarty;what a piece of shit apple really screwed over their design hahathe camera is all lg they even asked lg to help them  infinity display really haha so pathetic the s8 and g6 both have infinity displays and both are alot better apple has that dip on the top of the phone that causes the screen to be out of place thats one ugly screengive me a break what utter trash apple has become
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charles Lang;thank you for the information as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lachemiz;webos was all right from the start
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rashad Jones;306 i bet arya could fool it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozzy Mendoza;ps mr mobile sounds like he got a fat check from apple or he just likes being a hype man
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozzy Mendoza;honestly pretty disappointed with this iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeppe Werring;i just wish apple would improve notifications and notification center they are just awful notifications and the notification slider on android is amazing one of my favorite things about android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;to me the iphone 7 plus jet black is more beautiful than the new models
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Domenico Lamberti;eurgh goddamnit webos was so damn good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Clifton Honaker;another fantastic video i give you props and admire how fast you put this video together professionalism and its very well put together on your presentation big fan and keep up the good work your videos are the best on the web my take on the iphone x i cringe on the slight innovation following xiaomi samsung and blackberry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;largg3;web os still rocks  and i still hate hp for killing it 1 if you agree
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alfredo Garcia;mr mobile you are getting better and better with time your narrative style and choice of words your use of images and flow of story telling is the reason i keep coming back to you when it comes to technology reporting thank you and keep up the great work ag
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hanif Muhammad;eargasm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jerry zhang;i love web osits real cool and convenienceif today have web os on the phone and have many apps that will be more great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Seegs;seeing all these palm pre references made me yearn for webos that was my first smart phone it was truly ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hideika;youre one of the best tech youtubers out there i love how your views are very unbiased unlike most youtubers out there
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ajproc06;there are 3 reasons why i wont be buying the iphone 10 or the iphone 8 first im shocked they didnt call the 8 the 7s first two has to with ios with android i can have show box on my phone and also with android i have a hacked app that gives me pandora one for free so i cant use ios as the os on my cellphone for that reason now i can use ios on a tablet witch its fine since i do like ios now last reason why i wont be buying the iphone 10 or 8 is the price like really like no cellphone should cost you 1000 even 700 for the 8 is still way to high yes i know samsung with there s8 and note 8 are charging about the same price but be real no phone should cost that much i say charge no more then 500 for cellphones and most people if they want it bad enough will have to take out a loan to buy it like this if i had the money i would have bought the unlocked blackberry keyone thats the most anyone should be charging for a phone so apple and samsung and lg and anyone who makes phones and may read this lower your damn prices on your phone they are way to fucking high
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ethan Davis;does it have usbc yet
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TECH IN 5;micheal youre too good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Henfrey;i must admit i dont customise as much as i used to with my android but ios is still too restricting when it comes to ui being forced to use apples apps for certain features and customisation to a point where i dont want to touch it  however i have to give them credit for using qi for wireless charging and with the apple tv selling 4k movies at the same price as 1080 and doing a free upgrade to 4k  that in itself is tempting me down the apple route for my filmtv content
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GAMETEX;apple skipped a number and what will happen now samsung skipped 6 and note 7 went blowing upso lets see
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Josef 03;man that black note 7 is so fing beautiful üò≠üò≠üò≠
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;im sure apples implementation of face id will be astronomically better than samsungs or microsofts  but it doesnt matter because its a bad solution to a problem that doesnt need to exist fast fingerprint readers are better in every way you can unlock the phone while taking it out of your pocket you can do it without looking at the phone you can authenticate nfc payments in one movement  so why get rid of touch id because it was on the home button and apple for some absurd reason doesnt want to move the sensor to the back like most other phone manufacturers have done they even have the perfect spot for it in their industrial design ie the damn apple logo rear fingerprint scanners when properly placed unlike the lastminute kludge in the s8 line are ergonomically superior to frontfacing underthedisplay home buttons because you dont need to adjust your grip to use them  this is no physical right click all over again apple would rather sell overengineered junk like the mighty mouse than admit someone else came up with a better design theyd rather users of 55 iphones employ the kludge of reachability to reach ioss legacy topleft back buttons designed for a 35 screen than admit android was more forwardlooking by placing the software back button on the bottom left  and theyd rather replace touch id with this technologically impressive kludge than admit lg came up with a better solution several years ago  the nerve of tim cook calling this illconceived and overpriced product a revolution on the scope of the original iphone is more impressive than the device itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SystemRichie;the iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harrybo;i gotta admit i dont like apple as a company pricing the same or higher price than competitors for less features but theyve done some good things with the x and i look forward to the popularisation of wireless charging over anything i wont buy the iphone x but i congratulate them for this and thank them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Didier Hernandez;i too get nostalgic about webos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Colorified;very clean intro
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jack Johnson;soooo 1000 for a harder way to go home go into multitasking and go into a control center plus a worse way to unlock your phone   so once the honeymoon period is over you basically are spending 300 plus more dollars for a less intuitive way to do things  just because a car replaces its wheels for super high tech electromagnetic rails doesnt mean the rails are better to use day to day   and the iphone 8 is just a 7s pretty much  i actually thought apple did pretty well last year with the 7 and 7 but this is really bad imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nizar El-Zarif;looks great but cant justify the one grand price for the entry model my lg g6  2 years contract which includes unlimted callingtexting adn 2gb data still cost less
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ender;this phone looks great honestly the iphone 7 looked shit to me this actually looks new the price though i horrible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;CAMPING DOESN'T PAY!;lol love your reviews so refreshing and smart
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nat Chea;the guys at samsung are probably chucklingüòÅüòÅüòÅ over the new iphones right now they might have been nervous over what apple might do this year but after seeing this theyre probably twerking throwing confetti in the air and popping champagne bottles saying guys guys its okay theres no competition here but people will buy iphones regardless lolsss smh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ubeydullah Yilmaz;my old samsung galaxy s3 had even face id scan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;even as good as face id is thats no excuse to ditch touch id because some people will still find it convenient i hate apples bullshit approach of choosing only one thing that it thinks is the best and eliminating all the rest instead of giving people the benefit of versatility thats why the s8 is so cool is because i have an iris scanner if i like that face id like approach and then a fingerprint scanner that works in conjunction for added convenience and adaptability in more situations
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SojoriTechnology [Kamruzzaman];it was amazing video keep it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SuperNovaHeights;the iphone x is the greatest phone of all time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sandesh M√≠√±√∞ Fre√¢k Sawant;apple   new iphones are the first smartphones designed for augmented reality  android  lenovo phab pro 2  zenrone ar  apple lies blatently isheeps will believe it anyway üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aditya Anil;dude  the background music  is so good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Swissguy;we have iphone x to give please subscribe to our channel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;OLBastholm;i really expected a lot of webos talk in this video not disappointed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;still has smaller screen to body ratio than note 8 81 percent vs 83 i also rounded both thats so sad they made such a big deal about the bezelless design and still couldnt make it have small side bezel if u want true bezelless design with 90 percent or above screen to body you need a no mix
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Duncan F.;this is the first iphone i could consider getting since my 3gs back in the day  prior to my iphone i used symbian after ive used android and love it  but nothing can steal me away from all my apps android smartwatch and the like
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dario Hall;im not an apple fan but i love the competition the cellphone market has as phones get better and better budget and low cost phones get really good for a fraction of the price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nicolas Raney;i will admit i wasnt too taken with the new gesture interface granted i can see why you like it and i could definitely see myself adapting just like you described but i just dont think its obvious enough for consumers i mean i know some mostly old people who still dont know how multitasking works on their old phones adding on two swipes from the bottom for fundamental actions that you do all the time as well as specific pulldown gestures that dont even have a little helpful software indicator like the bar on the bottom to indicate that theyre there and i just think that the average consumer would be more confused than relieved at the changes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Redowan Nafi;the phone looks extremely ugly with the cutout and the ugly ios icons v30 and note 8 still look better but holy crap that monster of an soc better camera ar technology and the face recogniton is a step towards the right direction
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Deividas Skeberis;what i like 1 4k 60 fps video 2 cameras what i hate 1 ios 2 no fingerprint sensor 3 no headphone jack 4 ugly looking bezel 5 price i think if youre an iphone user you should get iphone 8 this one is just too expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;itsbiju;the iphone 8 is probably going to be the least sold iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;skelleytor;what i want is a shatterproof screenid be nice not having it in a clunky case all of its life span
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harpreet06;wireless charging is great ive got it in my car and its in mcdonalds too i dont think its that rare faceid is a gimmick takes longer than fingerprint to unlock even if they remove the swipe up then everytime you check the time itll unlock
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emanuel Sirbu;i wasnt an apple fan but this time the iphone x really got my attention im already saving money to buy it d
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nir Kopp;apple did good this year i admit but im sick of apple been so popular for no reason that have stopped being innovative and start using features of others
iPhoneX;MrMobile;drees84;control center is now up top that actually annoys me a lot having it at the bottom made the ios more onehand friendly now it was forced to the top to make room for the new home bar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;THANK YOU;to compare products  prices etchttpwwwqoo10sggalleryq108030459
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Frazier;i was very excited about the announcement i am a selfproclaimed phonebigamist cough captain twophones cough but i think my overall disappointment stems from four things 1 overly high expectations i dont know what i was expecting to see most everything that was shown certainly met all expectations due to the incredibly prolific and accurate leaks but i left feeling somewhat underwhelmed by it all once i saw that the emperor had no clothes i couldnt not see the overthetop marketing speak and hype for what it was 2 the iphone 8 line while unarguably superior to the 7 doesnt hold a candle to the x the smaller chassis the nearly bezelfree oled screen the lack of chin and forehead and the improved cameras on the x make the 8 the phone that the otherguy buys i fully admit i buy some phones not only for the function and form but for bragging rights im not proud of that fact i just recognize that its a powerful motivator for my next phone purchase 3 the x delivers in november while thats not at all a big deal to some im impatient again im not proud of that aspect of my personality but there it is i want it now and hyping it up and making me wait makes me feel well disappointed 4 the geewhizgoshthatscool features they were hyping as revolutionary faceid edgetoedge screen faceunlock and animojis either already exist in my galaxy s8 or are at least for my demographic just plain silly i mean sure  the talking chicken thing was funny and cute but am i really going to use it maybe once or twice but its not likely going to be part of my daily usagepattern the relighting effect in portraitmode doesnt honestly look any better than what snapseed can do am i just too old and crotchety for this phone maybe id even say probably but even though im docking myself points for being impatient and using my techdevice as a statussymbol rather than a tool im going to give myself a few points back for resisting the latest in gadgetlust

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matija Tomic;i have one simple question  how do you power off the iphone x since there is no power button there at all just the siri button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jamie Reid;itll all fail it always does apple have become the polaroid or the smartphone world just a brand

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Richard Servello;ill be waiting for the pixel xl2 announcement to decide on my next pocket pc  its between the iphone x pixel xl2 essential phone and the new xaomi
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nicolas Montiel;im glad google gets to announce the pixel before preorders of this go live i am actually compelled to go back to apple‚ò∫Ô∏è
iPhoneX;MrMobile;J√∂rgen Nilsson;face recognition seams mush slower than fingerprint scanners so is this a deal breaker
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Frank Williams;wireless charging is a gimmick
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Micah Lennon;hope the iphone x can get that face recognition working because doing the press conference it failed bad   and it was 10000000 times slower than apple home button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;FranzRara;929 note 8  wtf samsung too expensive 999 iphonex  kidney for sale 
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Richard Servello;its an idential approach to windows hellowhich works amazingly well  i have it on all my pcs and i just sit down and it unlocks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rohan Ramkumar;people calm down this phone is for the extremely rich people who dont like to use a similar phone as that of the  peasants  üòá
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Azam domino;in term of sorfware  marvelous
iPhoneX;MrMobile;thecityboy781;so if you dropped it youre pretty much fucked
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Richard Servello;apple used to do things betterbut i dont believe that anymore  most android phones run flawlessly and android is a fantastic os now  iphone is now just late to everything
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aniki;smartphones have become so fucking overpriced why would people want to spend a fucking grand on a device they just use to watch videos take selfies and use social media when they can do so for a fraction of the cost
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kaala jadu;iphone x vs note 8 camera  iphone wins software android wins fingerprint scanner samsung wins screen  equal processor apple wins extras spen headphone jack samsung     stereo speakers  apple so samsung wins final verdict nobody cares get what you like but note 8 wins
iPhoneX;MrMobile;AchillesNYC;the game demos were actually not that compelling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fishkeeper63;i think itll probably be an amazing phone but its still nowhere near worth the money especially here in the uk where theyre selling it for the equivalent of 1330

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Prashant Sharma;better buy s8  there is optional home button  top of bezel is straight cheap  except camera everything fine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mititelu Radu;i love the apple is betting its reputation  what reputation  the reputation that they offer less then ever before for more ever before the reputation that is milking people for money the reputation that if you have an apple product ppl will look at you like you are retarded because you have 1300euros phone 2000 plus euro laptop and you have to have a bag with cables with you the reputation that their own products dont fucking work outside basic jobs because are incompatible with everything on the planet including other apple products this is the reputation that they are betting sorry to say but is not really that much today my friend who have an iphone 7 plus got hers macbook and she had to use my old htc m8 to setup the laptop because there was no way an iphone with mobile data connection will speak with and macbook to share a data connection 3000euros in technology that is shit in real life use again this is the reputation that apple is betting
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Hennett;slower charging is the biggest wireless charging killer for me

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Godson Eh;the future isnt looking good for apple with this samsung would say to them weve been there and weve done all that and by now huawei must have realized that they are going to maintain their no2 position in the smartphone world cos this wont cut it for applehahahaa
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tauhid ahmed;i like unicorns
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Just Doin' Life;i appreciate this guy souch for calling apple out but with class they literally take old technology and put their logo on it and then it becomes exciting to the rest of the world its shady however its genius in keeping the company relevant while riding the success of they name they built in 20072010 i will never spend my money on an apple product but im definitely enjoying the climb of their stock because i know for sure that millions of unconscious consumers will clamours for this old phone in new clothing ü§£üòÇüòàüí∞
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MiLoHWD1983;the iphone x is not waterproof tsk tsk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;madsdgdhg;how did they tough that having that notch on top ruining the design and the full immersive screen experience was a good ideia its horrible look at the samsung s8 or even better the lg v30 thats how its properly done they could even put a front facing speaker in thw bottom and why removing the fingerprint reader why not simply make the apple symbol on the back a finger print reader yes they cant innovate anymore
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SARSX452;i phone xpensive thats what the x stands for
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Debabrata Acharya;introducing face id at the keynote and the whole time i was wondering what about identical twins getting access to the phone and that first ever face id unlock fail was further messed up when the guy tried to wipe his face for a better chance
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gerald Mumphrey;screw the iphone 8s  if i was going to buy an iphone i would get the x however i like android and will be over here waiting for the pixel 2
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ravi Charran;any headphone jack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;apple copied home screen and multitasking panel straight from web os or blackberry 10 remember apple is same brand who sued samsung for rounded corners

iPhoneX;MrMobile;sachin mhatre;apple continues to copy features gestures of the now defunct palms web os so sad that apple will be praised for copying various features gestures of web os i am myself a user of apples laptops and not a apple hater as such but just think that web os should have got credit for doing great things but unfortunately hp just killed them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;im not so sure about the legal implications of face id i mean what if it has a racial bias problem apple doesnt really have a diverse workforce also toowhat if something happens to your face and you cant unlock the phone why couldnt apple just turn that nice apple logo into a rear mounted fingerprint sensor
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dani Podis;big potential if it werent a monopoly product line

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aar√∏n R√∏hrbacher;but does it have usbc instead of the stupidly proprietary and slow lightning port
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Isaiah Lucero;ill probs just get the 8 depending on how much per month the x is

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rex Cosmos;michael youve been the strongest advocate for wireless charging for some reason i was happy for you when they announced it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Captain Prats;mrmobile  that duracell pun was top notch  üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;spritewon;what confuses me is you didnt mention any negatives on the phone such as the 999 price point or the fact he nearly locked him self out of his phone on stage during the keynote trying to use the face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;valent666;what about analmoji
iPhoneX;MrMobile;peter stringer;look how slow face id is on that iphone though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;CrayDude345 // RageEX;apple can sorta fuck off  i say sorta because they can still improve
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sean Murdock;so i guess ar is not a gimmick right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;dat boi;iphone x makes iphone 8 outdated and iphone 8 design is way too similar or same as last year design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;York Town;ios 11   a11 bionic chip is just fucking overkill
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rohan Charlesworth;id only call the face id a win if the device supported touch id as well still i have used windows hello with my surface book since launch and it does work well so i have no thought that the face id will not work the issue arises that if i wanna pay for a coffee etc taking my pixel out and resting my finger on the back of the phone whilst i lift it out of my pocket is just miles more intuitive then getting my phone a look at my face in the middle of a queue etc just seems apple being awkward again for the sake of it they easily could have fit a touch sensor on the rear of the phone but then they would have to move the branding which a form over function company like apple wouldnt
iPhoneX;MrMobile;V;1000  idiots life
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Henning Gu;i‚Äôm excited for the future of wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrKodanNche;i still think the lg v30 is more beautiful than the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Azcoon21centuryworks;wow i always hated apple but this is a really really good phone i actually like it almost even more then the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Awayze;happy with my i7 at ¬£1000 ill wait a few months before picking it up as no doubt itll be the best phone out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eir Apps;no way face id is ever going to be as reliable and convenient as touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;watch iphone users act like face unlock is new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M & H;the apple just jumped to the iphone 10 to get more money from yours
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M & H;the iphones 8 and 8 plus still the same shit but only the iphone x is better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mutio86;lets be honest apple failed in putting touch id under the display and try to market face id as the next big thing which it isnt also when i got my phone next to me on my table i wanna unlock it like that not having to pick it up or hover my face over it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ry Estares;the thing is no manufacturer released something new this year manufacturers only made screens bigger batteries bigger more megapixels etc no one released a new technology that will make our lives easier
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ponchi;if there are twins that hate each other and one stays in a room and another stays in their mothers and faps the the twin unlocks his phone and looks at the search history im not getting iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Willie Blanchard;this is a good phone but its nothing innovative this phone is everything a a bit less that the essential and s8 plus is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ponchi;what i hate about face id is when you picture someone and show the face on his phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Willie Blanchard;the face recognition doesnt work if your eyes are closed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mutio86;i dont want some swipe bs i want a home button also reachability i use that all the time and on a tall 58 screen considering to switch to android waiting for the pixel 2
iPhoneX;MrMobile;FSR;conclusion the best thing about apple is       other phones

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;i dont think face id is going to be all that great specially when it comes to apple pay this is what i hate other companies do these features that the new iphone has for years and suddenly when apple do it oh they do it better and i disagree
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;i disagree with the wirless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;yeah but apples not going to do wirless charging any better as its not going to be fast wirless charging and will be looking at 3545 hours for a charge
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;apple adopting qi is surprising and nudges some respect from me  first since the apple macintosh ii
iPhoneX;MrMobile;visionpersistance;people seem to forget that jon rubinstein who was among the many next inc personnel who arrived at apple along with steve jobs when he returned in 1997 and was appointed the first senior vice president of hardware by jobs during the 20 era and a lot of the palm pre hardware and software team originally worked on the purple project or the original iphone before being hired by palm so its not surprising the pre was the only other device worthy of comparison with and arguably superior in many aspects to the original iphone

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hosni Guiling;iphone 8  meh iphone x  üòç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ITX Official;as an android user i was quite impressed with yesterdays keynote and really enjoyed watching the presentation of the iphone x apple finally caught up with todays standards and managed to produce a phone that ticks almost all 2017 smartphone trend boxes theres one thing i highly disagree with you though you said that wireless charging wasnt really a thing until now and that it will be way more popular with apple jumping on the bandwagon i dont know about the situation in the us but here in austria and also germany wireless charging gained a huge following since the introduction of the samsung galaxy s6 qichargers are getting more and more popular on amazon with new devices in all different shapes and forms coming out weekly yes it will be even more popular now but that doesnt mean it was just a niche product before
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Awais Yousaf;iv been watching fishers video for a long time now i always appreciate how good mkbhd videos looked and sounded but i guess mr mobile is my new favorite such an amazing amount of effort ps mkbhd also freaking awesome dont get me wrong here
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tony benard;i find your video and review so fake u are not sincere unless your review is basically your personal taste which reminds to ask is this video for yo personal view or followers r u a tech fanatic or just a bandwagon
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lewis Lr;what about 8 and9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;50old gamer;what a expensive crap really man
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Johnny Doe;to sum it up this doesnt have a fingerprint scanner headphone jack usb 31type c memory card or dual sim like the g6v30s8 has a lesser resolution shorter aspect ratio ugly essentialer cut out on the front and the back looks kinda ugly too but thats just my opinion its also glass which is not as strong as the ceramic back going around in a bunch of android oems to top it all off its more expensive than the better competitors
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Johnny 1 Gear;so not only has your fingerprint been recordednot thy will link your face to your print bravo apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Macky Clemen;is it weird that gestures remind me of the blackberry playbook

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayank Gupta;as an android user i hate to say apple did it but hate not for ios but because of inflation itll cause in mobile market it happened during neymar and itll happen next year in mobile market but good thing apple improved a lot of old android features and implemented them best way but android customisation will fill the software gap winwin for everyone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A98hzm3D;the side bezel is 2007
iPhoneX;MrMobile;arpan roy;plz stop praising this shit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justian Edzard Maulana;608 you are absolutely right about those gestures when i got into bb10 in 2012 maybe the gestures is something i really love even now i still miss those gestures from bb10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arjun Chaks;mr mobile 60fps videos curing cancer all over the world
iPhoneX;MrMobile;manoj mondal;i dont like the design of iphone x that bezel at the top of the phone looks very ugly there should be no bezels at all or there should be  bezels both at the top and at the bottom of the phone there is no symmetry in this design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moritz  Engelhardt;in germany over 1100 eur for the 64gb iphone x and they showed it live face id doesnt work probablyno way and at first apple has to pay the 13 billion eur taxes they have withdrawn in the eu bevore i gave them some of my hard earned money
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dave Kos;i agree the swipe gesture that replaces home button is genius apple dont just digitize the round home button it transforms it thats where android cant compete with apple the gesture solution is easy intiitive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Jenkins;i wonder what the cross over of apple users and cosmetic surgery fanatics is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SAW9;props to that quick editing

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Bourke;michael gday from sydney aus quick lg watch related question has something happened i turned of auto on when wrist tilting and i am getting 2 days of battery life with full notifications access how about you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;molimits2;michael its clear apple wants people to use face id so the marketing machine on their innovation works  but cant help feel they ignore what customers want apple was the phone that just works fingerprint scanner and headphone jack work there is no way a face scanner works better  maybe just as good at most but not better  so why remove it cant buy this for one minute that its good for consumers only for apple  great video otherwise always love watching yours first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M Stuart;bad design and the price is just taking the piss  but at least theyve finally discovered oled and wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shahan Gilani;no one except lewis form unbox therapy mentioned about the failed face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Naveen Mahadeva;cant believe i disagree with all of your points really disappointed with the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Zionessus;people bring up the problem with identical twins like everyones got one
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hubert SAMUT;best iphone x review so far especially because of the perspective you give about every feature very good job
iPhoneX;MrMobile;oiman01011010;lol the face recognition is just bullshit it only your eyes for unlocking thats why they even specified that if you dont look directly at it it wont unlock and that why it doesnt work with a mask of the owner its just another iris scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qwertworks;i am of course a bit put off by the price but it looks very cool i am especially thrilled for the gesture controls gestures are awesome the only thing that annoys me is that you now have to reach up for the controlcentre  that is very unintuitive if you ask me  i hate it when things are out of my thumbs reach
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JBroMCMXCI;apple is shit samsung is best

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Average Joe;i dont want to carry around a cd sized charger a plug is just fine with me i think the x is a crippled failure releasing a 64gb version is a insult it is not really bezel free just look at the ugly chunk at the top of the phone i am really anticipating the real reviews once people stop sucking apples dong and are honest about these phones i bet they shatter at a 3ft drop what amazed me was that the 8s look just like the 6 the emoji crap was embarrassing to watch and no one applauded the game
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Constant Culture;soiphones 911 next year

iPhoneX;MrMobile;P. Vivek;iphone x magic is back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Grabovskiy;only issue is apple still makes compromises for the stupidest reasonswhy not put a finger print scanner on the back i used to be stocked on face unlock on android and it worked reasonably well untill it was like 5pm too dark sorry appleeither give me the full package or just forget about me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Crazcompart;although its packed with features its just too expensive for my blood
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Thanh Tran;you forgot the hideous cyclops stolen from essential
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bao Pico;remove front cam  fake id  better display

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ziyab Najeeb;apple air power dd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Henderson Moyle;another awesome video thanks michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;face recognition is still just another way to unlock your phone  do you seriously need all that protection
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lesley Harrys;no promotion baffling its a nice phone but there simply isnt enough to make me switch back to iphone i really wanted to but there is not enough to justify paying nearly double of what the v30 or mix 2 will cost me sure ios is way better and the iphone x is better in a few ways but i dont like the look i dont like not having a home button whatsoever and face unlock is slower and less convenient than touchid  its the first iphone since the 3g came to the netherlands that im not buying not on day one and not for 1200 euros 1350
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;for any sour grape android user wanting to convince someone to hate apple or pick a phone that you prefer dont bother android has 2b active users they should be fine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheCaptainBaker - TCS;huawei mate 10 will be better people might buy that instead its gonna be announced before the new iphone goes on preorder
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sandy Sandy;the iphone face recognition failed during the presentation itself lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rey Dawid;thanks for saying the truth because apple say things that make people think that there the first ones to do something but thats not true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tiger Gray;iphone is out dated sorry but it is true lg v30 galaxy s8 and moto z2 are the real innovation for 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chadwin Deysel;number bonus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maxx Tan;mikes got some mad narrative skills
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Devilicious Innocent;as always apple introduce old technology like its new n isheeps praises them like wow innovation lol anyways apple is far behind in features üòØ gr8 videoüëç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;laharrison53;the wireless charging is ok but what if you have to charge it while you  are in your car  i dont want to have to stop some where just to charge my phone i also want to be able to use my phone while it is charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaqib Bora;so will we finally see mr fisher using iphone as his main device
iPhoneX;MrMobile;geek;lol at people who hates and bash iphone but im pretty sure when that thing hits the market those haters will buy one sure theyre not anymore the first to implement  innovate new technology  but insteadthey are now implementing the technology the right way the seamless possible way to use it which is more important than putting the technology first but fail at once
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Leon C;tbh that home button could have done a lot more
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maslah Mason;first they collected personal information then fingerprints and now faces
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WailDiagram 23;yeah blackberry gesture for a start swipe up to go home lol yep slow charge  thanks blackberry z30 forever üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;EnhancedNightmare;kind of meh actually i like the long awaited removal of chin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Peizxcv;very exciting phone to bad apple cannot build enough to satisfied all the demand and have to resort to releasing iphone 88 and charge a premium for x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GreenStorm01;your argument for our future being a bit more futuristic now apple is aboard the wireless charging train to me is basically saying that apple somehow holds our future hostage cool things wont become reality because apple isnt implementing them that everyone else did doesnt matter anymore scary thought in the morning thanx for the vid keep up the good work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Flam3Sm0k3;they didnt mention fastcharging         or did they it was 300 am where i was watching the keynote so i was sleepy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrWazzup112;chutiye it failed on stage too deep in apples ass mr mobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cash Bonanza;apple used to track us with cookies phone numbers location emailetc now they have face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ultra DMX;if not for the iphone 10 and s8 note 8 would worth it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mickias mekonnen;this guy has one of the coolest tech videos it is amazing the way he does it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sumit chatterjee;iphone x is so costly that you cant even in joke about it üò≠
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ehrgeiz;i actually really like the x its unlikely i can afford it but if i came into some money id probably buy it and get a  lg v20 for home video recordingstreaming  instead im likely to get a lg v30 sometime early next year  loving the gestures as well windows 8 was misunderstood and the face id is just typical apple turning a sort of ok feature into an industry leading one  great video as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond Petit;bah not impressed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;iCrackr;hate to say it but youve got a point apple released a new iphone with old features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rifky Tristan;cant wait to buy v30
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nikhil Sharma;i am surprised you didnt give credit to bb os10 for all the copied gesture controls
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rivengle;here‚Äôs a thing  if you can restrict yourself from buying a new phone every 23 years the iphone‚Äôs price is quite reasonable apple supports their devices for at least 5 years and with something like the ix you can expect a ton of support again only if you can stay satisfied with one device for a long long time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evan Mansfield;iphonek
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozan Erbekta≈ü;iphone x is a forced smartphone its almost like apple felt like they had to make something for 10th year anniversary
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kunal tipre;old hp elite x3 have iris scanner and a lot of features its a very strong phone for the price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;janyves teare;always wait for mr mobile to set it all out much easier than watching the launch video  thanks dude
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mashud Mohammed;too much money üí∞
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rico4you;thanks michael for this perspective after the event for different view than the rest of folks impressions yes apple has demonstrated once again with a lack of creativity you copy improve and give to the masses this is their model
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JalalKamil;i liked this iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;iSebaa;great review you are taking it to the next level man

iPhoneX;MrMobile;tiramisu;i dont like your line stay mobile my friend change it it doesnt seems right we always stop every once in a while
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Valentin Marcellin;ive been a hardcore android fanboy through the years the x has me considering playing for the other team
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;why does everyone say andriod had it first its either lg had it first or samsung or some other company not android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cash Bonanza;if getting rid of the home button is a step forward why not do it for the iphone 8 as well
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Gomes;theyve done a brilliant job with faceid the rest of the industry should be ashamed that their implementations are so half assed and lazy and if course its a cool looking phone but i still want to hang on to the home button for another 2 years and i want to downsize from my s7 edge so from the beginning i was more interested to see what the 8 would bring i was really hoping for dual cameras on the 8 but sadly thats a plus feature only so im torn get a iphone 7 with sturdy metal back for the next 2 years or a newer faster 8 with a fragile glass back will have to wait for the drop test videos i suppose
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Youngblood68;i have the s8 plus and after seeing this iphone x  and i have always been anti apple  i am seriously thinking of getting this phone damn i was impressed question will its screen be as good as the s8 plus sharp and bright
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pekow91;great vid as always the best
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jacopo Carboncini;iphone xpensive

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Haresh Valecha;best video on iphone initial impressions yettrue critic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jimmy Pai;top notch is too ugly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mamur Akhmatjonov;quality only 480p
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eunus Moin;loool i will buy s8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jason Boyes;had to put price up samsung have there pants down for the screen
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeff Jarvis;a great high production video but a little overboard and generous wax lyrical about how apple has made face id better but then fail to mention that it failed on stage
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pyrosdestiny;the prices are becoming ridiculous 1000 for a phone is a joke and consumers need to talk with their wallets and tell these companies these phones are now too expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Monkey D Luffy;had to dislike mrmobile this time the ladt time apple did things better rather than doing them first noththing that iphone brought to the table that xiami samsung lg google pixle and htc havent already brought to the table
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moviefan137;iphone x no headphone jack home button or multi window still no qhd display comes with a widows peak slimmed down bezels wireless qi charging face id and ar functionality 999 usd please totally worth it such a good deal joking aside i have had enough of waiting for apple to catch up with android i am just going to buy an iphone 6s 128gb and then leave the apple iphone line behind i do not care if apple perfects features android brings to the market by waiting years after manufacturers of android smartphones such as samsung and lg bring the features to their devices and improve them how much innovation does it take for a company to copy the competition and then act like the appropriated features are the greatest new features to be added to a device since the creation of the 35mm headphone jack too soon the truth can be hard apple is no longer what it once was in fact apple looks a lot like microsoft did in the ballmer era rebranding time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Myles M;i still cant believe how apple  select this design  its not balanced and i think thats why apple has released those 8 and 8 plus models to play safe   galaxy s8 screen looks better than this
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gavla Tennis;the face unlock feature didnt even work during apples official unveiling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Merritt Cluff;nice review  its good that iphone has upped the game a little the x looks compelling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImmortalInflames;lets not forget the phone failed twice during the presentation  and thats not even considering daily life from sunglasses hair cut facial hair make up etc oled screens were invented by sony  this phone really is a tech demo of what can be done in the future except we have to pay 1000 perhaps 1400 in australia for apple to get free intel on users basically a big survey we have to pay for  to end on a positive note im glad apple is making the x look more modern rather than a coat of paint every year though this look was already achieved by the xiaomi mix  essential
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arsalaan khan;samsung misplaced the fingerprint reader making it completely useless apple took it a step further and removes it completely  google will try to beat iphone x price with their pixel xl suddenly lg v30 looks like the phone to buy in 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sander169;in 510 years iphones will be 14001600
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hassan Ger;first gestures based mobile os is nokia meego first released as meemo in nokia n900 in 2008 and then meego in n9 in 2011  the legend os killed by the idiot elop
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kertys Moro;1 features came from android 2x stand for xtupid 3 dumbest design ever 4 maybe for there 20 anniversary we going to have a new designe never seen before iphone with a pencil so people can make notesü§îü§îü§îüòÇüòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aliff Suhaimi;why they called this iphone x why not iphone 8 its not like apple has discarded iphone 8 completely like iphone 9 because apple launched iphone 8 as well however it looks more like a refreshed iphone 7 iphone 7 special edition or se and not a new phone instead the hype train that we all aboard in at the beginning are actually routing to the iphone x instead of the iphone 8 i feel sorry for the iphone 8 it is placed in an awkward spot between the the transitional period of iphone 7 and iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vikas Gurjar;im not here to bash apple keeps on telling apple isnt first one to do it every time lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maksim Mihhalkevit≈°;the problem with other smartwatches is that they are designed for men they just don‚Äôt look good on girl‚Äôs wrist that‚Äôs why apple watch is more popular it suits both genders
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alex Dau;donthavemoney team
iPhoneX;MrMobile;venom5809;people will bitch about the phone phone will still sell life will go on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeffrey Wong;999 wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaj B;id rather apple get rid of all the crap in the top make the screen uniform and put touch id in the power button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fawad Bilgrami;never seem mr mobile that excited for a device before its launch based on mkbhd the oled used didnt look brighter than his note 8 perhaps apple is over hyping it who knows  ill wait till i see it too early to say anything one thing for sure either iphone 8 is dead before it was born or apple has iphone 8 as their back up plan in case things dont work out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hurricane's channel;apple is awesome they rose up from the dead again and they do it all the time every smartphone company has their name in red and underlined
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaj B;yeah but its all nut and void by the price tag of ¬£1000 but ¬£1150 for the one you really need because 64gb isnt enough they should have started it at ¬£900 and had ¬£128gb for ¬£1000  im not getting one because i think ¬£1000 is stupid i could afford it if i really wanted to but i mean its ¬£500 more than anything iphone ive bought in the past i dont think its worth it since the new one comes out every year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kushal Brs;watching on my note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fendera;999 and only 3gb ram
iPhoneX;MrMobile;svtrader;sorry buddy x will flop
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nihar RD;nice
iPhoneX;MrMobile;„Ç¥„É≥Ëîµ;its cool to see how most of the new designs now all revert back to front and back glass panels just how the iphone 4 was back in steve jobs days not a fan of apple at all but have to give all the props to mrjobs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jed Teng;at least you did discussed the improvements of the phonenot just showing the phone itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hangga Teguh;no matter how fancy it is headphone jack is still my favorite feature so i wont buy any new smartphones with no headphone jack hell no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chinmay bapat;i am surprised about how u r still seeing positives lol maneverything about it a old worklike u said just adopted by apple this time and the prices are ridiculous taken to another level p its just exciting to see them adopt and then push ppl to actually buy those devices hilarious
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pip Hacker;my sony xperia xzp is far better then iphone x  y or z ‚úåüòú
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Morgan;im so glad you also recognize the importance of webos in our current software palm was way ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;david G;this phone looks ok but  thousand bucks is way to much for a smartphone  ill pass
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sud maharaj;i have to disagree that apple dont do things first  but do them better this principle works both ways  tick apple first released the retina display innovation  tock samsung then improved in the retina display using oled and larger screen doing it better for 2  3 years  tick apple releases siri innovation  tock google introduces google now google assistant  doing it better  tick apple release apple pay innovation  tock samsung release samsung pay that works with nearly all existing poss doing it better  apple deny genuinely useful features  when others introduce them and then confirm that others are correct when they implement these features i see apples adoption of qi wireless charging as admittance that the industry is moving along without them why did this take so long to implement why did they hold out so long  it seems they no longer had a choice  this phone is full of comprimises the screen cutout is ugly and nonsymmetrical which detracts from the experience by obscuring on screen elements  symmetry is naturally beautiful  the lack of fingerprint scanner is a usability  accessability nightmare which adds steps to the unlock process they could have added a fingerprint reader on the back but it seems they value form over function  kudos to apple for face id though it seems to be very secure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KKB1976;boring both the video and apple products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Suzaku 4000;uh oh arya stark wont be able to open this phone then lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;1MICRO11;iphone made from samsung galaxy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Parth Sharma;dual camera lens face recognition edge to edge display fingerprint sensor bluetooth 5 stereo speakers all have been there in the market before the game is who does it better and this company knows how to play it better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;The M6;the iphoto x is cool and all  but a 1000 for a phone with enhanced features is just too much imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pedro Scroggin;i like the design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gamesfo 100;the comments were 666 so i had to change it ur welcome
iPhoneX;MrMobile;2SidedTech;iphone x seems like a great phone but that price tag is ridiculous that super retina hd display cant compete with the s8 display or other android smartphones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gustavo A. Rios;dear mr mobile i am a fan of your style panache and overall the way you review tech however on this video i just dont understand how you did not really addressed two really big things about this iphone x  the 1st one is the epic fail apple had on stage when demonstrating in real time their new face id unlocking feature and it miserably failed that was unreal and it clearly demonstrated how it is possible that this technology is half baked and not ready for prime time yet now on this i am willing to give apple the benefit of the doubt and the mishap couldve been nothing more than an incredibly inconvenient mistake for not enabling face id first but if that was the case shame on these so called pros in their shiny new expensive building for not doing their homework and making sure that the most important feature of this new revolutionary iphone went buttery smooth they looked like beginners at best i mean cmon  2nd to me is incredible how no one is saying or at least addressing the highly unsightly black panel on top of the screen a black patch that terribly hangs over everything you do on what couldve been a beautiful and flowing edge to edge display when i was seeing all the mock ups form the plethora of sneak previews on youtube i was pretty confident that apple being great at designing elegant technology would address this horrendous black patch with software and black out a portion of the top of the screen to make this hideous thing discreet but no i was wrong now you have to endure seeing this black stain even during video playback i just dont understand how is this is acceptable under any circumstance and you mr mobile did not address this otherwise very obvious shortcomings to me these two issues make the iphone x unpurchaseable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dr. Sam X;my htc10 can shoot at 4k60 with the google camera port
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khadijah Frye;stabbing the button like a lab rat üòÇüòÇ dammit now thats how im gonna feel until i get an upgrade
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrew Iannacone;my 3ds has a dual 3d camera augmented reality two screens one of them being a 3d screen and even an audio jack beat that apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dandelion;im waiting for the new google phone i gotta see what they have this year i just hope theyll put dual speakers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Domen M;never ever ever going to use face id  remember people they warned us about chips in our bodie to tag us like kattle now you are makein it easy for them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nick S;the removal of the headphone jack was enough but now the home button fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Â≠ôËÉúËæâ;i would like to know what shape is the iphone x screenshot
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RacerC45;why the hell cant apple just bring the headphone jack for gods sake whatever happened to if it aint broke dont fix it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Handika;is it really worth a thousand dollar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kev;its unreal how ugly a phone can get by just tilting the cameras the other way
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bandy Ahmed;1000 the 64 gb how much for the 256 gb
iPhoneX;MrMobile;iMiguelAOG;im proud of apple they made a phone that goes toe to toe with the galaxy s8 now they just need a note 8 competitor
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tech Defender;once apple introduces a feature dumb or cool everyone else copies or inpliments it take wireless charging once apple releases iphone 8 itll make wireless charging a bigger thing i just hope others dont take away the fingerprint sensor for some stupid face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Professor Scot;glad you are excited but  dont you agree that many of these feature are already out of date or has proved to be a failed technology with batteries that last many days moto z play moto mod what is the point of a phone continuously charging   iris scanner means that you might as well remove any password protection to it  while i bet the camera will be great the only ones who will make money on 4k at 60 fps are cloud based companies likeapple i will be interested to see if this feature is popular who knows  ar  what is the function of this feature  great for 10 year olds serious i love baseball but i didnt see any value in the heads above the players now gestures  finalmente this will be a useful aspect to the os but i bet nova launcher will add it during its next iteration  have fun
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KornKernel;it never fails that micheal fisher is on point apple isnt known for being first to adopt certain technologies sometimes yes but mostly not thing is when they finally catch up with something because of the apples popular branding and developer support they contribute to making that technology adopted more popular and matures bit more quickly in this case about wireless charging which is a relief that they use qi wireless charging standard instead of proprietary implementation which apple typically does this will make wireless charging popular and widely adopted everywhere just like how the fingerprint authentication which is not new at all but after iphone implemented to their own all other devices quickly followed  this is basically what excites me more than the phone itself even im not even an iphone user for a very long time im looking forward to these technologies more widespread adoption benefiting us all in the long run
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SPMobile;so its not so much that apple does it better but more that because apple is doing it that itll be cool and start to trend think you should change that intro a bit michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shahril Isa;not even interested with the old tech which combines into new gadget whats wrong with apple now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Unicorn Workhorse;very refined stuff android is my city but this is pretty dope expensive as hell though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vanuatoo;i think faceid will spoil iphone reputation

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Steven75pr;is it worth the 1000 starting price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nehal Adhikari;but does it have promotion
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rob Watkins;excellent observations as always sir
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael V.;were did the phrase  top up  come from  it makes no sense
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kitkat Emm;i will never understand why apple is the company that the rest of the smart phone industry looks to for adoption when the iphone doesnt make up the majority of the the smart phone market android does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Carlos Pena;is this the same intro background music for oxygen os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;berryfairy68;cant get over that weird notch at the top of the screen  still love any michael fisher review üòÅ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Soldier-2Point0;smooth transition to the ad üëèüèº
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Ramirez;its alright im an android nerd not a sammy fan boy but i have an s8 and the note 8 is boring to me cause its too similar s8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Iam Yasuo;1k nope
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MyHairyChin;apple is a lost cause i havent looked back at them android for the win
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Motherlov'n Jones;i have this feeling fingerprint scanners will become like headphone jacks sooner or later slowly phasing out but surely will
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Christian Sabalza;this iphone x is the father of iphones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Adrian Lowe;plz do a review on how we‚Äôll face id will hold up against makeup and if u get a cut on your face or something üòç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Das' Lame;still waiting on headphone with a dac which is bound to never happen on iphone so this year lg v30 is the smartphone for me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BJ Mendez;that camera hump
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anonymus;no hell no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Prime Tambayong;iphone x is finally catching up to recent phones dont even know why they need the 8s around the 8s are not competitive on the screen front otherwise 90 of the x in components wonder how good the battery from the jump to oled even the v30 is getting better battery than the g6 missing from all of this is 120hz screen and faster charging what happened fast charging is more important than wireless charging oh well the airpower sharing of wireless charging is cute does it do 2 phones  also improved are speakers 4k 60p 1080 240 and probably the new 3d face scanner wonder how that works with ski mask
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maaz Khan;why are you always at baseball games then if you dont care about baseball
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam Corona;apple is lame as hell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Brewzer NM;as much as i dont like apple every time they bring up a new feature or improve an old feature they always nailed it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kelsie Ellis;nah
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrew Louden;like you im an android user but i still think the iphone x is pretty cool not one grand cool mind but a nice phone

iPhoneX;MrMobile;pspslimicesilver;as always michael amazing work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;received my note 8 today the iphone x will make a nice addition to my collection
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Christy;i dont like the iphone x at all because it feels so unapple and without the awemastic the iphone x went full samsung mode i find a lot of these features useless and gimmicky im so unimpressed i love my iphone 7 and will stick with it the bezel on the top  camera hump on the side look so ugly i love apple for their design and this phone just looks so ugly i dont care about specs if the phone looks like a galaxy from the view if i wanted to buy a galaxy i would not one with an apple logo on it to me this was terrible as i felt apple was less apple and catered to the spec nerds that love driod to join the apple clan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dango Ruiz;i draw the line at 1000 for 64gb of storage in 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A mar;no apple any more when the price is now gonna of course cross 1000 us
iPhoneX;MrMobile;oscar e;i probably will still take samsung wireless chargers because of fast wireless charging and the fact that the newest charger doubles as a pad and stand

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nolan Haynes;having followed the development demise revival and open sourcing of webos having owned a blackberry z30 and having owned various android phones i am excited to see various features and technologies come back in this form i am also saddened by the fact that it is now available on a phone whose design language is form over function whose battery life will be shorter than i am used to whose os is not open source to a good degree and does not follow open standards for crossplatform development and whose price tag is that high for what one gets

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joseph;you know i just literally just came to the realization that this is by far the best tech phone especially youtuber there is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;joes04redrx8;really no home button or touch id i dont give a fuck what anyone says but the face unlock is an absolute joke its extremely unpractical as you have to hold the thing somewhat up to your face no more just slipping it out of your pocket for a quick peek or the half tilt move on the table to check your phone why do you think android hasnt moved forward with this because no one uses it  same with wireless charging you cant really use your phone while its charging sure its cool and all but once you wake up a few mornings with your phone only half charged because your notifications buzzing away has moved it out of place on the pad you will ditch that too

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nilesh Ghayle;problems with face id can be the same as that of the iris scanners we already saw it failed during demo another problem ie the inefficiency under the direct sunlight may also be present as the similar ir camera which works less efficiently under the direct sunlight is used it is interesting to see how much battery drains due to the face id and if iphone x overcomes these problems what is the option if  it doesnt reverting back to pin unlocking

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evelina999;i dont think that ditching the fingerprint scanner is a good idea i mean the facial recognition is cool and all but there are situations where i cant or dont really want to take out my phone and hold it up to my face just to unlock it a fingerprints scanner is just more convenient

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Roshan Chachane;apple is betting its all on those bunch of sensors but hey let us not talk about the low res screen poor camera functionality in comparison to lg or huawei copying of gesture features from out of market phones so that no notices keeping the same old archaic design from 4 generations straight still no dual windows hideously protruding camera like some street lights unwieldy and wide and these features will soon appear on tons of chinese phones with half the price

iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;i hate apple and that those bastards are trying to make it seem like all these features are crazy new innovation you do bring up a good point however that apple adding this stuff will make it more mainstream which is beneficial for us android users still the fact that they make it more difficult for everyone by still insisting to use their own software makes me hope that more and more people come to realize how apple simply doesnt make the best phones and switch over

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr. Cheesedoodles;living in canada with our outrageous exchange rate i am torn between buying a 6s or a 7 to upgrade to from my nexus 5 the 6s is 599 cad and the 7 is 739 cad the 6s plus is the same price as the 7 and the 7 plus is the same price as the 8 at 899 which is too much imo im totally fine with 32gb of storage and while i do like android i want a more consistent experience this time while both the 6s and the 7 are in my budget i am leaning towards the 6s because of the 140 difference and the headphone jack but i really want my next phone to be water resistant and i can live with a dongle can someone give some advice

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Francisco Fernandez, Jr.;the iphone x is the bestlooking phone ever released by apple it looks like a modern android phonetho theyre still sacrificing function over simplicity
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pito VH;yes i agree with this video if all this big corporations have to copy each other to move the technology forward i say go for it all we have to do as consumers is defend the prices and dont let them rape us i want the iphone x even though is way overpriced but when i find out applecare is 200 and have no extra features shit 100 more now apple is playing greedy  they are really fucking us over the youtube tech community have to speak for us because the price are too damn high

iPhoneX;MrMobile;McRocket;first to me the best reviewfirst impressions  so far  that i have seen of the new iphone  second apple is very slowly dying this is bland nothing but evolution zip revolution jobs apple was about revolution among other things taking chances with new ideas andor new ways to do things it was little to do with the best tech  but a new way of using existing techthat few had considered the iphone and the ipad to name but a few apple gadgets were revolutionary all the iphone 8 and x are is evolutionary very expensive evolutionary sure apple will sell a ton and make a ton off of these but if this is the future of apple  take no chances and just be evolutionary then apples days as the cool tech source for people with some bucks are numbered oh its a big number but they are numberedguaranteed btw  my phone and tablet are appleso i am not an apple hater

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Freshly Squeezed;i can see why someone who has the money for this and has been really waiting for an iphone worth upgrading would want this but ive been searching everything from the underdogs all the way to the top dogs but compared to all of those the iphones just get more boring as the years go by if youre a really big tech nerd

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gov3rningEight;been a apple fan for a couple years now i currently have the 7plus but i have to say the new iphones just dont seem worth the money  the x is amazing looking but their are so many androids out their woth the same if not more features than the x and 8 for example look at the v30 beast of a phone when i upgrade in december i think my money will be with the v30 or wait for the s9 in january
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;545 he brought up webos rip
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Salis Salman;holy cook what i fail to understand about apple approach on faceid isnt touchid much faster and more convenient than faceid its just another caveat now indeed its a neat feature but doing away with the tried and trusted touch id which so many apps support and so many people trust is just ugh no words
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TeeBakes;idk i respect apple for finally removing those large bezels but they are sacrificing a home key i like physical interfaces and removing the home key is like chopping off a ring finger some people would be fine without it but other would miss having the finger a wedding ring or a sesame ring in this case for michael

iPhoneX;MrMobile;D13H4RD2L1V3;i actually prefer the iphone 8 over the x  yes i‚Äôm that person
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Diegifier;i think apple is a great company but to be fair i would rather prefer an android smartphone i would get the lg v30 but this iphone is probably the best one yet

iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrSpaghetti;lets hope it works better than when craig used it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bobby King;apple gave up on touch id on the screen cant blame them they are not innovative enough galaxys9 may have it samsung rd will get it right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;indranil majumder iphone 8 plus is 1080p
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Indranil Majumder;would have gone with iphone 8 if the display was atleast 1080p
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;dani podis exactly fuck israel and long live palestine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qory Azkia;dani podis fuck you israel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;walisson guimaraes ive spent 1000 on hookers might as well spend a 1000 on porn watching on the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KeybladeScar;yash akkara because i wanted the x at first but apple made me upset about it i mean its a cool idea but i just feel like apple should have made the x the ultimate phone but if ever upgrade ill be getting the 8 plus anyway but my 7 plus will be with me for a long time lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;if you are not gonna buy it then why tf do u care
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KeybladeScar;pamplonahd haha i have my iphone 7 plus ill be okay for a very long time üòÅüòÅ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;keybladescar c you can have the iphone 8 then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ashley Davies;pamplonahd haha true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;ashley davies at least it didnt blow up in the custumer faces  like some other products outhere
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bryce Jian-Roy Carin;christian at least its not as nonsense as the way you spell products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;it actually has 60 hrs audio so we can listen to music constantly for 2 and a half days
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;you guys just dont get it do you even the video said it its not about who did it first its about who did it better youre logic is that you would buy a worse phone just because it came first 1010
iPhoneX;MrMobile;spritewon;pamplonahd i dont see how i am being stupid but the reason i watch mrmobile is because he is more critical on his videos than other tech channels and any other time he would have mentioned the price such as with the note 8 which was ridiculously high as well and the only reason i am using the note 8 is because i had a note 7 and got 425 off
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;spritewon just trolling or simply dumb
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;yash akkara o u must didnt see the video where it failed on stage at the keynote
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;unlike facial iris scanning on android this cant be fooled there are legit videos on youtube that show them failing and they dont work well in low light apple tackled all of these and their face id is 20x more secure than touch id they even went this far to make 3d masks by professionals and the iphone even tackled that maybe not new but far far better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;c3 u didnt have to say the no shit part cuz i actually agree with u my guy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;C3;montrez porter no shit most iphone users arent nerds that follow the industry all they know is iphone and any feature will always be new to them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;–¥–µ—è–Ω –∏–ª–∏–µ–≤ yah apple is going to flip alright
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;ryan collins me too i prefer the aluminum back it feels more premium glass backs are just more chances to crack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Asher Perlmuter;samuel james do they need to be apples proprietary butt cheeks or will it work with the industry standard
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;asher perlmuter put it in between your butt cheeks and squeeze
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;tony benard yeah i agree the real innovation is what one plus does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;luke williams digital bezel lmfao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;luke williams no it does not technically have less bezels than samsung galaxy note 8 note 8s screen to body ratio is higher watch the video
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;optimus27 i think it looks sexy and also its a matter of opinion and plus it looks cool a snit actually technically has less bezels then samsung note 8 because it has a digital bezel with home button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;rihasanat rofolo modern design i thought that too till they throwed in a fat over sized brick with huge bezels around the entire phone with a nasty looking dimmick at the top middle of the screen no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;User0225;lol those are not bezels the screen itself floats and curves and does not sit on bezels lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;daTutankabron;rihasanat rofolo the black thing on the top makes it ugly af
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lars Bolduc;it actually is ugly the bezels are quite large compared to many other phones the bezels remind me of the original iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rihasanat rofolo;how is that ugly one of the most modern designs out there you must have a poor taste in design

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bass Based;you mean 1799 nzd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris Malaspinas;sunny sandhar what this is ridiculous
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Holly Hsieh;note 8 is cheaper than iphone 8 plus here xd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Heng Theng;it fuckkng 1700 here maybe 1900 wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Holly Hsieh;also add 84 for fast charge
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond AKP;youtube red its because we have high taxes and whenever we buy a product 25 of the price goes directly to the state moms
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;raymond akp that‚Äôs really expensive why almost twice as expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;samuel james t mobile is doing the trade in for the iphone and att is doing buy one get one free on the iphone 8 also the iphone x is 33 dollars a month from my carrier no one pays full price for phones unless you dont care
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;my problem with android is that it is not well designed because of the abuse of user options i see customisation as a tiny benefit as it only changes the aesthetics and sometimes how things function from a design standpoint the amount of customisation android gives is more of a huge disadvantage it gives the user too many options which confuse non techsavvy users theres a design principle called the flexibilityusability tradeoff that states that limiting user actions can improve usability and that extremes on either side are really bad ios has a good balance of flexibility and usability android does not android chaotically smashes into a wall it gives too many options and disrupts a proper balance and flexibility and usability but typically fandroids dismiss this because they think the user should just learn the os better however i say the goal of a designer is to build an interface that is intuitive and requires little brainprocessing android fails at this and therefore fails as a simpletouse os the amount of customisation options within the ui is too large and requires a high to huge learning curve however those who are willing to overstep this learning curve may find a liking to the amount of fine control however we cannot call android well designed the majority of human beings do not have the time available to learn an os to many an os should just do its job and get out of the way with the extra fluff and is the reason many choose ios over android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;3165dwayne;eddie r if people were smart and started voting with their wallets that price would fall
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond AKP;in denmark 64 gb version costs 8899 dkk 1430 usd and 256 gb costs 10249 dkk 1647 usd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;joshua sandoval just stop with your iphone buugaa buugaa every android phone is unique just like every windows pc is unique nothing surprising there whether you liked it or not android is far too superior to ios in terms of customization and software variety every person with an iq of over 30 should be able to use an android phone otherwise there is something wrong with you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;when iphone fixes its software and adds all the necessary features thas when ill change to an iphone  youre fng joking right android is way worse than ios will ever be ios is fast intuitive and seamless android is not android does have a lot of features but is too crammed with features and it honestly it becomes really disorganized and confusing not to mention that every android phone is unique adding further to its problem
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;optimus27 poor ass 1k isnt overpriced for an iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;luke williams i like iphones speed and fluency however the phone it self is way too restricted and lacks simple features that android phones have when iphone fixes its software and adds all the necessary features thas when ill change to an iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;optimus27 hey the iphone 8 is a solid amazing upgrade and is 700 which is cheap in 2017 and is worth it an apple is selling  all new lines from 6s and more for 10th anniversary
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lee Squires;simple help productions ok thank you for letting us know
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yahia Mostafa;from the phone ad they said the technology would work well in the dark
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tiger Gray;chris liberti 1000k no thanks lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Liberti;tiger gray i tried both the s8 and moto z2 force  both are ok but they don‚Äôt work with handoff and such for me  i returned to iphone and will be getting the x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;geek;maybe you missed steve jobs sorry hes dead  we can only enjoy whats being offered today  is that making you sad killing you me enjoying all the tech both apple and android while im still alive yolo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RD Simmers;geek hahaha im still going to point and laugh at all the idjits paying 1000 for the name and i was an early adopter of both apple ii and macintosh just dont like the way the company has gone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Everett Bonds;apple got to make enough to pay samsung to make the iphone 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RD Simmers;sell to the masses at an exorbitant price fixed it for you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;jimmy pai try look at the mirror before judging beauty
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeff Jarvis;pamplonahd the android flagships already have it microsoft already has it with windows hello implemented by a whole of range of pc makers well not apple obviously hey i think it‚Äôs great that apple has finally caught up with wireless charging and waterproofing too great also to see them opting for slimmed down bezels well not the iphone 8 or 8 plus that‚Äôs still the same 4yr old design but the iphone x finally looks more flagship android and that can only benefit consumers i assume you do like a gorgeous large oled screen we‚Äôve loved em for years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;jeff jarvis in threee years from now all android phones will have a similar face id implementation apple leads others follow
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;arsalaan khan you have to a really spastically retarded person to not be able to use the fingerprint scanner like fully retarded child spastic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;poeglives;arsalaan khan my thoughts exactly the phone that understands bluetooth isnt a substitute for for a high end dacamp and that some music collections drastically exceed others
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrSpaghetti;so stating actual facts  bashing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fendera;that is only proof that the cpu is more powerful
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;that 3gb ram kills the note 8s 6 gb by a 2000  benchmark  rip
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;fendera tell me what could possibly be gained from an iphone x with six gigs of ram for example versus one with three gigs of ram tell me 100 what value ios would have with six gigs of ram versus three
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Green;fake facts to make apple look good nothing new while your at it be sure to microwave your iphone for fast charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;linusmlgtips ya really cool feature üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;sudarshanmaharaj uhhh samsung has been doing oled longer than that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rafi Yagami;even that face id fails to work at the event lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sud maharaj;linusmlgtips samsung pay is a different beast it uses  nfc  mst tech which allow it to function with the majority of legacy payment systemsmagnetic card readers it also allows for online payment such as amazon  by your own admission these are weird sides the fact that apple allows you to black out this ugly cutout is only further confirmation of a design compromise your also losing screen size if you do this
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LeGoogle Chrome;linusmlgtips he mentioned samsung pay for a reason bud also how is apple pay better than android pay anyways its literally the same system nfc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LinusMLGTips;sudarshanmaharaj two things theres an option in ios 11 so you can black out the top so it looks a lot cleaner than having those weird sides also apple pay was better than google wallet for the time period
iPhoneX;MrMobile;am3ient;lars bolduc marketing terms like infinity display lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lars Bolduc;lol retina doesnt have a meaning its just marketing retina displays were not innovations and phones have always had higher ppi than the iphone also samsung supplies the displays apple uses in the iphone saving the best ones for their phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LeGoogle Chrome;sudarshanmaharaj yeah face id is probably the best facial recognition system out in the market right now but the fingerprint scanner is a solid choice dont know why they couldnt just add one to the back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;dr sam x please do a demo on that that sounds cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;it‚Äôs a rectangle
iPhoneX;MrMobile;suvrat sharma;holy shit  didnt think about that a really good question though ü§î
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Â≠ôËÉúËæâ;emmmmm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MyHairyChin;yash akkara  its ok your blinded by apple ohh and canada ftw üá®üá¶
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;my hairy chin does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Prime Tambayong;also ios dont lend to good long screen display hard to reach the top should have made the clock bigger or have the music widget on top
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;dango ruiz what if i told you you could get 256 gb for 800 and it was made by apple gasp
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;marcus lc will you people give it a chance like come on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;syren serpe no 600 should be the most
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;pls buy the iphone 8 and shut that hating trap thanks  logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;James Penwright;agree  i will be sticking to my 6s as touch id is very convenient for me  face id is a joke
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;joes04redrx8 shut up you know you cant live without iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;joes04redrx8 makes sense to me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nilesh Ghayle;what will those folks who were criticized iris scanners heavily because the phone had to hold in front of the face when it could be unlocked immediately while taking out of the pocket using touch id say now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;vijay r what did you expect a curved screen a microscopic stylus and a ton of bloatware yeah thats innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Godson Eh;you sound like a female on ios emotionally driving
iPhoneX;MrMobile;fattah qalbu;damn i cant agree even more im and adroid fan but just because the ios is not so userfriendly but damn this iphone x is totally mind blown for me im really hype for this year smartphone now ill just have to wait for the mate 10 i reallr do hope the mate 10  ould give the iphone x a really solid run for the money and hardware
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrew;geeks life i hate ios and other iphones but damn i gotta admit the iphone x or 10 is really tempting the camera performance even face id looks better and the fact its similar to android by sliding down for the control panel is awesome
iPhoneX;MrMobile;let's begin gaming;yash akkara lol what the fuck are you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krishna Adettiwar;ddd bbb you dont have to hold it up to your face because it senses depth based on the demo on stage it unlocked perfectly and he didnt raise it up or anything to look at the phone theyve made new chips and its the first phone to have these chips and sensors and a neural engine dedicated to this so its in another league compared to facial recognition and iris scanning on other phones theyre claiming its supposed to be even more secure by a long shot than touch id which is pretty insane
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;pls buy the iphone 8 thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;evelina999 then use password dont be stupid  using password is cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Keino but you can call me Kei.;kingslayer controllers are the whole function of the console i dont want to spend extra for wireless crap
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;m√¶ko nobody is asking for wired controllers to return for the next playstation or xbox get with the times buy airpods
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;ayush zaheer  webos 2009 qnxbb10 20112013 meegosailfish 20112013  some 2011 ui returns in 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;dominick brown 3ds and vita had it years ago  actually ar existed with sekai camera in 2008 when i watched the keynote this morning it feels like ar is really vr but without the headset you end up moving alot more while playing games im more into ar for educational stuff that sekai camera showed or word lens which google bought to add into their google translate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;- XPL0S1V3 -;5 clicks on the power button and it disables fingerprint and face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pety;abh037 oh thats actually really cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abh037;theres a quick shortcut to disable biometric authentication on iphones im not sure what itll be on the x but on my 7 plus its pressing the side button five times after that youre required to enter your password
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Scrom Diugh;or just dont get in trouble with the police seriously when has an officer asked you to unlock your phone are you a criminal
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pety;they can do that with any biometric login since its not protected under the fifth amendment of course talking about the us if that concerns you i would go with the pin or password
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andre S;well its broken so tadaaa fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sole Nation;close ur eyes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;krystal myth yes it does alphanumeric pass codes are allowed on iphone a
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ali CHAHIN;well they can force you to open it by holding your finger to the touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eli Czaplinski;nfamouz princezz good things twins are pretty rare then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;nfamouz princezz you have to keep your eyes open to use the 3d facial scanner for security reasons  httpsqzcom1073209whatisapplesnewfaceidandwhyisitreplacingthefingerprint
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NFamouz Princezz;de techie facial recognition isnt the same as an iris scanner closing your eyes would do nothing also a twin could unlock your phone üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Lamoa;paulson thomas ü§£ü§£ü§£ true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Team3Gaming;krystal myth yes all iphones allow that üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Team3Gaming;paulson thomas cant they do the same with touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;jack calow jesus you guys are the seed of our demise should just let them put a camera in your house because you have nothing to hide
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jack calow;dont break the law then lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JUNIORFAKE;m i c h lol these women cant have an iphone now lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;sam m women in burqas dont use facial recognition maybe iris scanner haha theyre stuck in the 7th century and they hate vitamin d
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;they can also do that with your fingers right now if you use touch id neither system is more physically secure although apparently you can close your eyes or avert looking at the phone with face id  this is the second dumbest criticism ive seen of face id the first dumbest being it discriminates against women in burkas
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;gameguy thats true but its not really a monopoly because android is open source
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;ndsb true but that‚Äôs what happens in every other market like gamingpctablets etc if there was one os it would be a monopoly in the phone market it‚Äôs good to have competition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;gameguy does it not make things more difficult for everyone apps have to be coded for two different operating systems unless they only want to be available on one
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;so your saying that your opinion is fact and other opinions are incorrect
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jerrod voong preach  nobody is asking for wired controllers for the next playstation or xbox
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SkidRow YourBoat;mayur hassija if dont have one well screwed again üòÅ

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;charlie surface is the best tablet bruh it runs full blown pc os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;charlie thats tru dude it beats almost all home  pcs even some gaming ones smh alex
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alex Smailes;charlie no its not
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;the ipad pro is the best tablet on the market though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;derSchwarzkopf;now srsly should they say at the unveiling ohh by the way our tablets are way inferior than the other ones i wouldnt recommend them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;alex smailes always have been sents jobs died
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ihsan Husandi;i am against the bezelless trends but it turned out i kinda like apples approach towards the trends than the rest of markets
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;buy the iphone 8 they released it for a reason
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ash89;glasssofoj  oh okay i dont give two shits about gaming on my phone so bezelless is the way to go for me and the majority of the market according to the new smart phone releases
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;ash89 i want at least somewhat of a bezel so that when i‚Äôm doing something in landscape like watching a video i don‚Äôt have my hands on the fucking screen because there‚Äôs nowhere else to put them the only benefit the bezel his phone has is the fact that you can make a bigger screen without increasing the actual size but usability still suffers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mary mulligan;hate hate hate itleft samsung because of those curved more fragile screen i understand the bezeless design but hate the infinity edges
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Thomas van Engelen;ash89 i prefer a home button no round corners and no edges the bigger screen can still be done by keeping the phone larger and more battery id choose that over a smaller phone anyday
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ash89;thomas van engelen nope the trend is the way to go who wants more bezel if you can have the same features with more screen why wouldnt you want that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;thomas van engelen i personally dont i owned sharp aquos crystal back in 2015 and samsung galaxy s7 edge now and hate typing on them  but we shall see with the iphone x first iphone im actually excited about since the 4 my other daily driver is still my v20 typing on it right now and its wonderful when it is flat and tiny enough bezel for less accidental presses its bulky though the x is same dimensions as my 5 pixel but bigger screen than my v20  im sorta 5050 with this trend so far if the x is as annoying to type on like the s7e i will still keep it as a memento its the 10th anniversary iphone for goodness sakes i still have an se and want to spell out iphone sex üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;thomas van engelen i prefer dual audio over copying samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;kinan hloubi gesture controls like webos is a big deal but yeah it probably isnt worth 300 more when 8 and x share similar specs except for that oled display and emoji maker front cam im discovering that the x wont have dual front speakers while the 8 will have it and be 25 louder than the 7  i joke that im rich i wished i had lannister gold but im getting the x for the feeling of xclusiveness that i hadnt felt since owning the first iphone when not everyone owned an iphone yet ante up and get the best of the best  it may not be revolutionary or is the best phone ever made but its the best iphone ever made i dont care about the ugly camera hump on the back nobody judges beauty by the back of a persons head im a little concerned with accidental touches face id being easy to manipulate from a stranger and that notch when watching videos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Guest4703;glasssofoj thats right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;guest4703 yep somehow a 50 price increase from the iphone eight somehow means double the price right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;vexward palm did it before samsung with the pre matias duarte brought it back with the nexus 4 in 2012 know your smartphone history like me and michael fisher do
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;vexward thats because apples implementation is not as dodgy as samsung i am an s7 user it stutters hangs overheats i am stuck on an old version of android wish i had an iphone maybe less features but solid core software experience just sharing my personal experience dont hate me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A W;wow and i thought it was insane for canada 1529 for 256gb but of course you will need appple care and they have upped that to 250 and then there is tax so 200900 for us canadians üò°
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Factz Knight;apple is fucking raping everyones wallets
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;plebking true but at least they didn‚Äôt only make the x this year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;PlebKing;gameguy with its 750p screen and huge bezels in 2017 nah the galaxy s8oneplus 5lg v30 are much better buys imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;PlebKing;isame 00 you can get a macbook pro for around the same price as the 128gb model
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;buy the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;you serious how much are the macbooks here in sweden 64 gb is 1100 and 256 gb 1300
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Patriotic Warrior;plebking in india it will probably cost 2100
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Liberti;twell609 yeah and android was almost 5 years behind palm adding wireless charging and some limited gesture navigation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;twell609 does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options 8 a far more efficient software  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Twell609;reza atabaki google duo for video chat they have allo to compare with imessage but imessage is better i have a google pixel xl and a iphone 7 for work my pixel is just better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris;well i go with apple because if he software and i have an ipad so is super easy to sync everything up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reza Atabaki;twell609 its not about the hardware give me something like imessage or facetime on android and im game but google cant make this happen remember for tech savvy people like me and you not having those apps is fine but for people that want an app like imessage that works better than every thing out there right out of the box then it creates a big problem also i had the note 7 it was the best android phone out there and i had switched from iphone 6 i can tell you that the app performance on note compared to iphone 6 was horrible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;everything but samsungs ui is smooth and optimized too its also not more reliable its actually been tested to be less stable several times than android go ahead google android more stable though ill bet 99 of you wont and will just say nuh uh again android though not samsungs forked ui important difference that doesnt work anymore as a selling point in 2017 almost everythings fast and butter smooth actually samsungs even are temporarily but they get a little slow over time due to terrible resource management and ram garbage collection being fast and smooth is the bog standard now aside from maybe 50 burner androids from 711 never used one but i dont feel too confident in defending those ones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;androids cant be either that was 2011 where does all of this bunk ass info come from he literally mentions that in the video it used to be crappy because it was new its 675 years later now windows has been doing it for years too it works very well and in the dark thanks to infrared
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;its called ios dummy thats why apple is popular their software is so smooth and optimized
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sarcasm_;twell609 heres the thing though apple may have less features than android but it runs far more effectively so overall still a better more reliable phone and its compatible with pretty much every single app
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BrechtXT;de techie software face scanning on phones from 6 years ago yes it was shit and could be tricked dedicated face scanning like on the note7fe galaxy s8 and note 8 works great and can‚Äôt be fooled by images
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ben Ginter;yeah except android phones are awful
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rigby Car;twell609 but not as good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;tfu true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;twell609 true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Owen Gee;danie johansson youre right ios is the worst part
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John H;glasssofoj its not the fact that you find the feature new its the way that people in the apple ecosystem act as though its revolutionary and innovative then apples commercials advertise it like its brand new on any phone ever thats why people point out the features are old to prevent apple getting all the credit for someone elses accomplishments
iPhoneX;MrMobile;daniel johansson;its the os dumbass
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;tmex same history like yours  20082010  iphone 2g 20102013  iphone 4  didnt buy another iphone until earlier this year with a space gray 32gb 200 se att gophone i actually dont even use it as a phone or is unlocked i just like holding it and showing off the doordash order to the cashiers so easy to hold and the design is probably the nicest among all iphones  used android back in 2011 with a nexus one fell more in love with it with the htc one m7 still the most beautiful phone design ever owned about 13 different androids first time in seven years when im actually excited for an iphone and its mainly for gesture controls and ios11 file manager and drag and drop  i will never leave android though no matter how amazing iphone x will be i have too many paid apps in the play store to ever leave it i even wear a google hat their apps like gmail gmaps youtube google voice and google photos is too important to me and those torrent apps and tubemate and swiftkey is way superior on android  google  life our online life
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;danny tanase nobody will be looking at the back of the phone all day thats such a shallow statement we do not judge beauty by the back of a persons head do we the notch bezel will get annoying though when watching videos the design is basically the essential phone but with ios
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;cesar munir thats because the iphone rejected his fuk face
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cesar Munir;httpwwwtelegraphcouktechnology20170912applesuffersembarrassingdemofaceidfailiphonexlaunch

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;fadhil priana fake news
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;your statement is contradictory
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Glenn;i thought you ment iphone was always first with innovation which is never te case
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;glenn what are u talking about android is 99 always first

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;cole byre yeah i miss webos too  sigh  favorite ui ever with the cards and swiping them up to close felt so amazing wished matias duarte implemented it more on android at least we still have nova launcher prime with some gesture swipes and double taps  thats the main reason i am getting the iphone x that and also because i plan to get the apple watch airpods and airpower headphone jack whats that eww wires
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;cole byre they have split screen and pip on ipads though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rakesh Botadkar Saiman Bobbypins;reggiehil no no ofcourse i dont mean that it seems they are thinking about the new problems that are existing and trying to tackle them differently thats all ill always be an android user üòÄ

iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;8bitzawad if you didnt know the iphone x design was already leaked before the iphone 7 was even released
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;de techie ya then perfected it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImThatKid;shawn fernandes thats not why it looks like a galaxy but ok
iPhoneX;MrMobile;whoahh;samsung not doing first idiot samsung stealing from lg g6
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;ive no idea what you guys are looking at
iPhoneX;MrMobile;5TAT30FTH3ART;how is this a clone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;kickroxeatdust ppl gave essential shit because if the camera cutout and so on but it worked so will this one work out too especially since theyre saying that the iphone x will be the standard for the next 10 years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;shawn fernandes although i not a fan of how the framing of the front looks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mohamad Meshhen;angelo tarantino hhhhhaah
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;tilted by box way to try to overide somebody with dont talk what r u a kid the iphone has no chin just a camera cutout chins are used to house display drivers which apple has managed to overcome if you watched the presentation youd know that the top portion is a camera cutout and not a chin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;shawn fernandes u havent seen essential phone or mi mixhere the top chin is removed bottom is there but still basicly the same concept right dont talk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;8bitzawad why would apple monkey anyone the designs been out there for a long time the front looks great theyve eliminated the chin on the bottom which the other companies havent done until now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;8bitZawad;angelo tarantino the front design looks terrible the essential phone and mi mix did complete bezelless right and the s8 and v30 got very small bezel right however the iphone looks like a horrible mix of the mi mix s8 and essential phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;De Techie;samsung got glasssandwich design concept from iphone 4  4s
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;angelo tarantino this is the second time they are doing glass design theyre not stealing anything
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;bassam alharbi id rather have the v20 for 369 new for the ir blaster and removable battery
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jacky yo;john914 mf  my father
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;miraclewarriors you‚Äôre right  phone can do more with glass on the back like doubling the chances that you‚Äôre going to shatter it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Researcher Researching Research;miraclewarriors true but you trade of a bit of durability for scratch resistance not to mention that if you drop this phone you have twice the amount of heart attack since it will be 2 sides that will breakcrack now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MiracleWarriors;aviral bajaj yep i known but many iphone users always thought that phones with glass sandwich design were a second tier stuff apple aways loved to say that the aluminum used on their products were the same used on planes and such but my point with my post was to mention that glass panel metal back panel even it it is more fragile and get smudges
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aviral bajaj;miraclewarriors glass phones have been a thing since years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rawaaaaaaaful;golden boy u r a mother fucker loser
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Owen Gee;golden boy you are complaining
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Golden Boy;fckin ksmzo so do you but you dont hear me complaining
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joker;fckin ksmzo it is shit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;the frozen space my dear face id didnt fail it was already recording faces at the backstage and well it isnt turning on because it wasnt craig it wasnt a clearly fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gianluccas Palhuca;the frozen space lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;the Frozen space;gianluccas palhuca new phone old feature escalating prices eh pods capabilities fail face id oh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lean dsz;yeah  but since  it is apple n  has better developers it will become much popular than the same feature in an android phone its a bitter truth though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lean dsz;abcdefg yea thats what
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abcdefg;charlie how much more can samsung really put into there devices tho all i can think of is dual speakers and better dac
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gianluccas Palhuca;for me  the note 8 is the best phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rafi Yagami;for apple thats innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reflex Sama;charlie  holy shit do you really have to be a smartass on commenting and correcting every single apple flamer with your copy pasting skills
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portrait lighting on the contrary what is a new feature that the note 8 has brought that weve never seen before the only thing i can think of is dual ois
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;kevin bailey but they never stated that it was their own invention
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;deyb it is whn u try to pass it off as new tech u invented
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;its not about who does it first its about who does it better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;gianluccas palhuca all thy do is copy old tech an try to pass it off to the bubble customers a new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];johnathanblade1 haha  yep thats apple for ya
iPhoneX;MrMobile;balaganesh;lebeautiful well mr mobile did say this  apple doesnt invent they perfect already existing tech ps companies should patent whore so much that apple to come to their knees to put these new techs in their phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M. Fatani;yash akkara nooo please buy the new iphone ita good for you like vitamins buuuuyyy itttttt
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;fucking hell the phone was restarted pls stop this nonsense
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harris Armstrong;all religions are fake you be in hell  you are fake not islam
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ben Tignor;the phone had just been restarted touchid doesnt work until you enter the password once the same thing happened here
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dr.Strangefreak;i just dont want to look like im taking a selfie every time i use my phone so faceiris scanners are a no go for me but im on android i have choice
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr Beasley;all religions are fake it failed twice n stage during the presentation soim skeptical as well it was hilarious to watch üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rrobertt13;fuck identical twins how does it work in the morning when you are sleepy how does it work on the beach in the sun how does it work in a carefully staged demo in ideal conditions on iphone launch oh wait we know how it did there it didnt work at all
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Masoom Rana;one hell of a lousy job these religion did roughly 2 millennia later none of their supernatural feats can be confirmed or recreated
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SuperNovaHeights;all religions are fake only android peasants will doubt face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Junior Flores;chris r source
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris R.;jesus would disagree with all religions are fakehe built the church and the gates of hell wont prevail read the church fathers ignatius polycarp and others who closely followed disciples and you will know the truth isnt something but someonejesus the christ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;all religions are fake i agree with your comment totally disagree with your user name and profile pic though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dario Hall;i think someone should get the phone and drop 20lbs and see it if recognizes him without him using the phone for the months that it takes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Darnell‚Ñ¢;armia khairy thats actually a good question what happens if you got surgery would it still work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;All Religions are fake;indranil majumder of course everyone knows that but they were doing a live event so i assume that phone wasnt rebooted just before commencement of the event it was a legitimate face id fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Armia Khairy;will your face unlock it  after a tough fight and with a screwed face ü§î
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Indranil Majumder;face id needs passcode after restart just like android needs pattern after restart after that it works seamlessly

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie4Christ;all religions are fake i hope you know that christianity is reality and not a religion remember jesus is the only way to heaven
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;use the pin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;jaycee clements  yes of course but do you not think that theyve thought of all that of course theyve thought of makeup hats hair whatever  anyways well have to see how it goes im sure well see more before the release whether or not faceid will be good or not i think that people are just overreacting
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;prayneke  how is the phone not losing its value a bad thing it just means that you can sell it later on and not lose a ton of money with most android phones they lose half their value within a year thats bad you dont want to buy a 100000 car just for its value to go down to 30000 in 5 years thats 70000 gone you want it to hold its value if not appreciate in value
iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;mayur hassija next time you go to android get a pixel im sure stock android will be as smooth as ios
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;jaycee clements does price justify the feature the answer is a no but it is worth paying it for apples great software experience having used an s7 and iphone 6s plus i can tell for sure that apples software is way ahead in refinement and stability android is yet to catch up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;glasssofoj thats not the point you shouldnt have to pay 1000 for a phone that arguably doesnt have much new features compared to its android counterparts also android phones significantly go down in pricing over the years whereas iphones never go down below 650 which is still pretty expensive the note 8 which has features that youll probably use headphone jack sd card slot s penwill be 700 by the time the note 9 is released but the iphone x will still be a grand
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;glasssofoj true and i have to agree with you on that although 300 is a substantial increase in the price from the base model anyone who can afford a 700 phone may have the budget to buy a 1000 phone but the point of conversation is do you think the increase in price justifies the features it has and how future proof is the feature imagine varying changes in conditions day to day life etc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;mayur hassija plastic surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars the iphone xis only 300 bucks more than the base model 8 but people act like that extra 300 is the most extremely ungodly increase of the price of any device in history  i mean if you can afford to pay 700 dollars for a phone i‚Äôm pretty damn sure you can pay 1000 and if you can‚Äôt you probably shouldn‚Äôt be buying the 700 phone in the first place either
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;skyartlerist d u can use any finger tho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;skyartlerist d if youre investing 1k into a device u best believe its features are going to be flawless and worth your money right now i can imagine more flaws than proper implementation i believe buying a premium device blindly just for pure hype without accounting unforeseen circumstancesnuisances is more stupid imho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;jaycee clements  sure you might not be able to even see if your face is disfigured enough cant use your phone then point is the whole what if your face explodes and you cant unlock your phone argument is just stupid imho there will always be whatifs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;jaycee clements wow never thought of tht
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;kingslayer agreed its a cool concept but execution wise its a fail what if i wear glasses do i have to remove my glasses each time i unlock imagine getting muggedsnatched when youre temporarily blind how about unlocking the device when youre driving and you have your glasses on reverting back to good old pin code password each time just makes it seem like a total waste of investment
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jaycee clements this x wont play nice to arya stark folks wanting to make a sex change like bruce jenner and people who love to wear costumes during comiccon and halloween
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jaycee clements luckily it is being released after halloween imagine wearing a darth vader kylo ren or iron man mask and needing to take it off every single time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;skyartlerist d then you probably wouldnt be using a cellphonehandphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;what if you get in a terrible accident and your fingers get cut off hmmmmmmmmm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;mayur hassija true but no plastic surgery can ever replace your original facial features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;ajay patil then the face unlock feature in the iphone x is rather flawed then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;jaycee clements if you can afford an iphone 10 you can afford a plastic surgery too üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Usama Shoukat;placing touch id on backüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;but then they wouldnt have that 85 screen if you want touch id take the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;wj does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;mdabul hossain only took 4 years and a whole slew of android software and hardware features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Freshly Squeezed;kevin bailey personally i think its the ugliest iphone design tbh that camera hump doesnt do it justice nor does the top bezel right in the middle
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;freshly squeezed best design yet tho i cant lie
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;freshly squeezed ive used them all and can be platform agnostic if i wanted to be they all can get boring actually i am more excited with ios11 than the hardware features from the x i think ios11 might be a bigger update than oreo im on oreo now with my pixel and i hardly see much changes android has moved pretty slowly too since transitioning from kit kat to lollipops material design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];ill definitely spend some time with the 8 as well yes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ihsan Husandi;split screen multitasking literally sucks on a phone honestly it only useful for tablet and as far as i love android ipad does way better job on split screen multitasking than the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DJ GMONEY;yash akkara but you can only have 1 opened on the screen at the same time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;it can run about 50 apps in the background which is huge samsung lags after 30ish
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;i can‚Äôt remember if anyone on stage during the keynote actually said multitasking but even if they did isn‚Äôt the official term that apple calls it actually the app switcher because that‚Äôs really all it is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;mrmobile michael fisher thy will copy tht soon to an act like thy invented it thr bubble users will belive them an b so enthused and fascinated
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;mrmobile michael fisher  i just find it odd that apple puts the pip feature on ipads but not on iphones probably to diffentiate and throw a bone to their tablets for people to keep buying them  btw pip on oreo still feels like beta i ended up using gplayer paid one wo ads just so i can play a video while watching youtube at the same time i used to use mobo player for years but it seems to be a chinese rogue app with wakelocks my favorite video player apps are mx player pro and gplayer  thats whats missing with iphones for me torrent apps like flud to download my game of thrones and the walking dead episodes and video miniplayer on the home screen google photos is a lifesaver for storage and photovideo album
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KevinIsSoAwsome;mrmobile michael fisher wish it had split screen multitasking but that would just be the cherry on top
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];multitasking is just running more than one app at the same time even if one of them is running in the background splitscreen multitasking is what youre referring to i think and no doesnt look like the x has that feature though it probably has the horsepower
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;lance tech good b8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Salis Salman;mrmobile michael fisher indeed apple has proven they can remove anything of of their products for the sake of innovation or maybe just for shock value and press coverage headphone jack regular usb ports on macbooks now touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];right yeah im really  i continue to be surprised that apple ditched touchid on this thing faceid better be rocksolid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;ssdada urdsada well u have one bezeless or one with bezels thats choice and the nub looks alright they wanted to eliminate chins but u have to put the sensors somewhere
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ssdada urdsada;they removed bezels coulda fooled me iphone 8 still has large ass bezels and the ipone x has that ugly ass nub bezel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;teebakes u have choices
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ed lonzy;mrmobile michael fisher haha my surface book has been really good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];depends on the device for me my surface laptop is amazing at hello but my surface pro doesnt know me from a dude in a big bird suit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sachankara;qnx is just a core like the linux kernel blackberry 10 was blackberrys own qt based gesture controlled os which worked on top of qnx
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jason Zimmerman;swipe up for home  ah just like my beloved windows phone  so much potential  we hardly knew ye
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;abhinandan darbey  palm webos did it first blackberry bought qnx and then rebranded it as bb10  im surprised matias duarte who helped create palms webos didnt do it for android since he has been with google back in 2011  swiping up to close apps feels so natural over pressing home or recent apps all the time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kenneth Daniels;mrmobile michael fisher webos touchstone  gestures i wanna cry   paaaaalm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ATW Tech - Alpha R2;abhinandan darbey so iphone x is infinitely better youre right there buddy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];this  i mean  i mean yeah kinda
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BalthazarTheGreat;qualcomm has the tech and the first phones to use it will be some vivo device q1 of 2018  it‚Äôs a special piezoelectric chip that sends waves through the oled panel then bounces it off the underside of the cover glass where your finger rests and can detect microscopic differences from the ridges on your finger print pretty bizarre how it works really but they claim it‚Äôs just as effective and secure as physical fingerprint scanners
iPhoneX;MrMobile;It's Akile;i heard it being challenging with oled
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krishna Adettiwar;patstar5 it senses depth look at the videos on how you set up face id you dont need to hold the phone up to your face it can tell its your face from all angles its very unlike any other facial recognition done on any other phone bc its using new sensors never seen before and has a dedicated neural engine that runs on a custom chip that helps unlock your phone based on a neural network they created of millions of faces although we need to wait to see how well it functions its apparently far more secure than touch id or the fingerprint sensors on other phones and its in another league compared to facial recognition and iris scanning on other phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;cmer;they were successful in using the technology but were unable to mass produce it in an efficient manner hopefully thatll get worked out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;patstar5 they wouldnt as theyve already left that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;patstar5 samsung will they work together with the company who does this i think samsung owns that company im not sure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie so they say well see in demo the guy got troubles with opening the with his face doesnt look good fingerprint way faster and better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;krystal myth you cant use a 3d printed mask to fool faceid they stated this in the keynote skin has a special spectral signature which absorbs or disperses ir wavelengths  so people that think they can defeat the next iphone using a photograph or 3d printed mask will be disappointed faceid has 30000 data points which are analysed compared to 400 for the s8s and note 8s iris scanner touch id under the display simply wasnt viable as it is incredibly hard to mass produce the new technology
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;you want them to push weaker techology to curb embarrassment this really is a narcissists age aduts are capable of admitting mistakes they can push face id and still have the integrity to put proper fingerprint technology on their phones some banks will not accept anything less than a fingerprint for identification and this is for a reason for one thing you cant use a dead mans fingerprint on a fingerprint sensor you can use a 3d printed face to fool face id dead or alive your face will work with face id its a poor replacement you dont want them being too proud here to be unable to admit it simply had to wait for touch id to be ready
iPhoneX;MrMobile;le mec Miranda;i read samsung is currently working on puting the fingerprint reader under the screens of their upcoming s9s they were trying to do it with the note 8 but couldnt mass produce it yet so they left it for the s9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel Chattergoon;idk even if apple figures out how to implement the fingerprint scanner under the display apple might not do it because it would be embarrassing for them if they did especially since they spoke really highly about their facial recognition  i personally think that apple should forget about touch id and focus more of their time resources and money on improving face id instead of trying to split their efforts on touch id and face id i could see face id failing in situations where someone grabs the phone and points it at the owners face to unlock it so thats something apple will need to work on and solve if they havent done so already  as much as i prefer having a fingerprint scanner instead of face recognition whats done is done no going back now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;patstar5 the technology is there theres a company that already made working demos some months ago but i dont know if they made a final product at all they will probably implement touch id back when they have the technology apple was pushed to release a phone that was not  behind on every aspect to an android phone minus the chip and the fluidity of the os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justin Beast;patstar5 id hope all manufacturers who can give us this technology use both but idk maybe these companies will be stingy and give us only one its hard to tell really
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;justin beast thats what im talking about when apple reveals the new iphones this time next year will they utilize this technology or just use facial recognition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justin Beast;patstar5 he means we may see it on later phones you cant add a fingerprint sensor under the display on a phone thats already released lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;vegito blue so will apple add it later on then how would they explain that off
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vegito Blue;patstar5 both tried but couldnt get it in time its not that they couldnt do it at all they just couldnt fit the date
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];its toward the end 999 expensive af
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;hurileno lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hurileno;which dosent have a physical button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;eurokers digital life hell ill even take a 3d touch home button but thats not even an option i guess ill stick with my note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;eurokers digital life preach
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Varga;except maybe the live keynote itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;FallingTitan;watching more then 1 vid is a waste of your time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Addy M;kid kaos and thats why we all flock over to his videos when a new phone is revealed üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];glad to hear it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaber Jr.;people were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time says a rep and didnt realize face id was trying to authenticate their face after failing a number of times because they werent craig the iphone did what it was designed to do which was to require his passcode in other words face id worked as it was designed to
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;stig name you are a idiot the phone is going to sell regardless of a human error he used it after that and it work flawlessly every time my guess is he grabbed the wrong phone first then he switched to the other one and it worked every time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;benjamin woods dont give me that crap it failed once and gave the message it obviously just restarted
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;it wasnt a fail the iphone said that a password was required for face id to function pay attention
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;even if it wasnt due to it not detecting his face properly of which there is compelling evidence it didnt detect it twice it was a slick ish presentation where that sort of things should not be happening as it leads to discussions like this and was therefore a fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Lamoa;dhirendra sahay for real
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lukez;alright then i was wrong thank you for your information but i think they had multiple devices there to show different things like the presentation of the iphone 2g i think it was the wrong one to show faceid maybe there was a different face registered but yeah your right it failed but still i think when it is released it will work great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fede D.Z;its his job otherwise he wouldnt be there would he if he is not capable of doing that why he insists in being at the stage if he cant handle things properly dont defend the undefendable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;stop with this freshly booted nonsense that is not what the phone said it said your passcode is required to use face id which is the exact same message you get for touch id if you use the wrong finger several times the message after a boot is touchface id requires your passcode when iphone restarts  screenshot from presentation httpsiimgurcom9l47rjwpng photo of the boot message httpsiimgurcomueogrt4jpg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lukez;no faceid did not fail i watched the presentation the phone was freshly booted it said your iphone needs your passcode after the boot after that it worked flawlessly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;African Pastor;dhirendra sahay yop yall see it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel the Omnipotent;the fact that the amount of people joining the fail during conference bandwagon truly amazes me he did not fail its required to enter a password before you can use touchid and same thing for the new faceid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;jamal blakk believe me michael fisher is one of those rare reviewer who does every review honestly and never afraid to hit apple on their face  so be patient for mrmibiles full review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jamal Blakk;yeah i noticed dude took a swipe at samsungs facial recognition in this video but he failed to mention apples demo of facial recognition failed on stage sup with that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Apple User 5151;david hunsinger dude mistakes happen and thats what humans do why are you creating an issue about this  man i am really pissed now you forgot what happen to samsung with the note 7 that was too a mistake l
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Apple User 5151;shawn mcdermott yes i saw it again and it showed face id requires your passcode and in the hands on video the apple executives showed the face id feature and it worked better than touch id and flawlessly these people are meant to do comments like these
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ya00007;mrmobile michael fisher you know how to rub people up the wrong way dont you btw why are your reviews so rubbish i keep falling asleep
iPhoneX;MrMobile;–°–∞–∏–± –ì–∞—Å–∞–Ω–æ–≤;mrmobile michael fisher way to go being an asshole to your commenters
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mia Tufail;mrmobile michael fisher i see today you are not the unbiased facts presenting reviewer i used to know you for
iPhoneX;MrMobile;EU hot dog;samuel chattergoon i would not date the girl if she was black
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chidiebere Nwaekpe;and apple isn‚Äôt bother is you decide not to buy one i hate how people just hate a company that make good products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LIKWID;jayy cole ah and here we have it folks your every day apple hater no reasons why they just like to hate gg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hasanshi sado;jayy cole i have the 7splus im telling you this iphone 10 is not what its made out to seem
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel Chattergoon;jayy cole you didnt even give a good reason for not buying the phone just because its apple was your reason thats like saying that you wont date a black girl because shes a black girl
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;wow youre so cool wow i wanna be a hipster cool guy like you when i grow up you dislike a product because its popular wow so cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jos√© Junior;kingslayer im not a fan either but this phone is just amazing expensive as fck but amazing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jos√© junior michael isnt even an iphoneios fan just like me but he recognizes great potential when he sees it hes the best tech reviewer period the best to ever do it sorry marques jon4lakers and so many others they just dont have the presentation charming sense of humor and voice like mr mobile does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Atulya Aman;daniele maglaque its 2436 x 1125 you look it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniele Maglaque;iphone x is 2k panel look it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;diegifier i would actually get the v30 if i didnt have last years lg flagships already  i love lg they arent perfect and there are some questionable quality control issues but among the best and most reliable brands out there i have mostly good things to say with every lg product i owned i tried like 14 or 15 different phone brands lg is up there with nokia and moto for me lg is underrated and quietly innovative which is what i used to think htc was  youre gonna love that wideangle cam plan to bring my v20 to rome next april v30 no longer has removable battery and ir blaster but it is still a winner and over 300 cheaper than iphone x they will get discounted under 500 within two months low risk high reward brand
iPhoneX;MrMobile;I love Androids, Dragons, and Wolves 1219;veejai k note 8android in general
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yongki Siaw;just chillin no just face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sajid Ahsan;just chillin there is no fingerprint sensor
iPhoneX;MrMobile;just chillin;reece webb isnt that a major problem then like so many times my phone is lying on the table and i just use the fingerprint to see any messages however with this i have to keep my face leveled
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reece Webb;just chillin no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spooka Doota;when portrait lighting fails on the actual conference its not an actual feature neural engines on a closed os is not very useful the note 8 is capable of it but is not updated yet shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lee Squires;researcher researching research typical android nut spouting the same crap every time an iphone is released obviously jealousthreatened well done
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;researcher researching research one could say the same about samsung at least apple didnt publish a 132 page internal doc explicitly stating they need to copy another company and i currently own 3 notes and an s8 plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable so why are you expecting iphones feature on android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 this is iphone not a samsung phone even some other android phones dont have half of the features you mentioned
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;charlie you can continue but do iphone has spen do apple has 960fps slo mo do apple has quad hd or 4k displaydo apple has dual pixel auto focus do apple has a proper file management system do iphone has heartrate monitor do iphone has blood oxygen monitordo iphone has always on display do iphone has iris scanner do iphone x has fingerprint reader do iphone x has 35mm headphone jack do iphone has fast charging shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ace Morales;raypossiable yea i guess so lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;ace morales apparently people dont seem to watch this video with volume on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ace Morales;researcher researching research the first thing this guy says is apple tries to do things better not first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImThatKid;hunkasaurus rex  lol stop you really should do research
iPhoneX;MrMobile;whoahh;i dont think this weaboo has galaxy s8 u dream it child
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;why does it matter that they skipped a number  samsung did it to get their two flagship devices of the same generation under similar branding using the same number  apple used x because in latin x is ten and its been ten years since the first iphone  x also carries the notion of experimentation which is what apple are claiming the iphone x is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Enigmazflo;antione english bro its not about opening apps but its about consistency in terms of battery life app performance and value for money look i am not trying to say that android is bad and stuff what apple has done with a11 for ar is amazing and dont forget the  face idcome on mate all i see these days is that people fighting  over who is better and not the hardwork put in by each manufacturers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;antione english;enigmazflo if you are happy that you can open apps quicker congratulations but what else
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Enigmazflo;researcher researching research dude iphones cpu destroys the current best line up available form android side
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie please do you need those to what 4k 240fps you eyes dont even see the difference to bit lower fps oooh4k sony did 4k shit way before apple they allready have 4k screen on phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raou TV;charlie please do cause it is also the first phone who copied shit ton from android world yet it still fails to deliver all the goods for its price lets be realistic i can get a phone that costs less than half and i can have better camera better display better audio and video meaning i will have both manually which apple seems to fail to deliver not to mention better battery life and a feature that iphone will never have a wide angle camera or an rgbmonocrome so i would either go huawei or lg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A Snell;charlie as for the camera thats why i paid good money for my canon and my computer if im that picky about videos and pictures as far as talking animal emojis thats for kids to use in my opinion and for women that like cute things to do as for ar gaming i dont play games on my phone period whether it was my iphones or androids and i cant just sit anywhere thats important and start playing an ar game picture lighting and changing how look is almost like catfishing to me lol if you feel your looks arent up to par then hey you can jazz yourself up then lastly i would have fingerprint scanning over face id any day on any phone  its not faster for one 2 not even twins have the same fingerprints and if you want to get really picky there is nothing 100 percent full proof out of any device  whether by genius force or hardwaresoftware failure someone can get in it im tired of gimick stuff from all phones i want to see more businessadult improvements for everyday using especially for spending thousands on a phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;well the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portait lighting shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;friendly911 OS;they dont they just know that people would buy it even if it was 10000
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;because theyre a company and companies want to make as much money as they can thats pretty much the main reason if you think about it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dany Rockwell;shareholders
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;because they can until they lost customers loyalty they still milking them with the high price tag
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;flyingdutchdude5 there was a story that said that apple will be depending way less on samsung for oled screens and also trying to make their own and also the price will get cheaper and also please stay with apple because the integration
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 because of apple needing to buy parts like oled displays the price increase because the parts theyre buying are expensive because of those expensive parts apple needs to make profits by selling it at a higher price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable may becan you explain
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 you still dont get my point do you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;eli;im sorry does iphone x have a stylus with a 4096 levels pressure sensitive screen mm no im just gonna wait for my red hydrogen to actually fucking innovate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;avinashrai11141 thats not completely true the market is responsible for that price point if the market can bare to pay that price then apple will continue setting that price pricing a product isnt simply deciding on a price for getting the highest return the market shares blame in that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable apple is reponsible for price of iphones or macbooks because apple has highest profit margin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;because they buy parts from their own competing companies especially samsung who you should blame for the price of the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Eckersen;but there is a point of diminishing returns where the cost is prohibitively more expensive than the performance you are getting thus making it a bad deal
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;10secondsrule because ive been a tech pm in telecom for the last 18 years and do all my work on mobile outside of that i am a phone enthusiast  the fact that it may be stupid to you doesnt make it stupid so no its not stupid again anyone who can afford to buy whatever theyd like and finds utility in it is not stupid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;10secondsrule;flames 8889 well it is stupid you just don‚Äôt realise it rather than pointing out grammar mistakes to somebody who probably is not using english as a mother tongue please do tell us why do you need all these flagship phones again
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Eckersen;of course they do

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;fastlikeuno the other two new  iphones have the touch id  im going for the 8 plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jedd Simon;fastlikeuno a lot will miss the touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Trapezoid;if i am not mistaken the error was because of the phone being reset so it required a numeric passcode
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];if youre talking about the demo id say wait until the thing is out in the real world if it sucks in real life you can bet ill tell you it sucks  but judging a product by a live demo two months before launch isnt cool

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Roy Reno;jorge munoz iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reino Yu;krystal myth lol you have background on this clearly you didnt its not just your facial dumbass its your 3d facial structure your facial structure has unique identifiers just like your finger prints do even more the 3d sensors do not interpret your face like how our naked eyes do it maps your face based on the unique points on your facial structure all these unique points have specific distance space contours and exact locations which are analysed and computed by their fast processor thats why it will not be fooled by even by twins there are small possibilities coz even theyre similar to their dna level yet as they grow up their body experience and responds to their external environment differently and so their body and facial structure cant be 100 similar if scanned into details it also works under low light as it uses infrared wave and even with makeup if you ever do your master degree i bet youd fail coz how you do your research is so poor just search 3d face recognition vs fingerprint recognition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;sio wat yeah there would probably be too much radiation that we would be exposed to
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sio wat;wifi and bluetooth are low power radio signals to charge over the air would require high power rays waves it would not be safe also the existing technology uses magnetic fields luckily they only act over short distances or they would blow electronic equipment air charge will never happen qi or some variant is all

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kalpesh Patel;its possible actually connectors right on the surface can do the trick wireless charging is already here i was xpecting iphone x to do so remove ports remove buttons etc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;it is not more secure ive background on this you dont need the kind of clearances ive had to know face recognition is hardly more secure than a fingerprint dude a fingerprint is a unique identifier that requires the owner be alive to even function facial recognition has no such conductive requirement a model of your face would be enough dont kid yourself here just to justify  a buy this is a reduction in security bar none no self respective security agency that uses fingerprint biometrics would ever see facial recognition as a replacement iris plus fingerprint sure face plus fingerprint yes iris and voice maybe facial alone fuck no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Xue Ern Neo;doge‚Ñ¢ face id can reportedly work in the dark i think
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;reino yu regardless of whether or not its more secure facial recognition in general is still not as practical than a fingerprint reader for example when you need to unlock the phone during the night you have to turn the light on having a fingerprint reader also means that you can easily just directly unlock the phone without taking it out of your pocket

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reino Yu;they removed fingerprint scanner coz they can introduce better technology which is 3d facial recognition its more secure than 2d fingerprint read the research not by apple they can remove the charging port if they can finally introduce wireless charging technology without using any pad which can charge over a long distance range why not for any data transfer to computer it can be done by wifi wlan its all about introducing new better working technology rather than sticking with the old one change can be good i wonder why people are complaining when it is working
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;jonaq niveer sarma i swear if you get this right imma give you my car
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moviefan137;iphone x no home button  iphone xi no charging port  iphone xii no display  iphone xiii no battery  iphone xiv an empty box  iphone xv no box it will only exist in augmented reality ar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;apple in 2018 in our new iphone 11 we took tremendous amounts of courage to remove the charging port such innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W. L.;tokekkk iphone x1
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A W;jackelofnar i agree 100 its ridiculous how much phones are  i have a feeling it will only get worse
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Miguel;jackelofnar that and fast charging cost 85 for a built in feature
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joe S;this is the premium model you dont have to get it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alex Willis;exquisite diamonds
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bob Jones;jackelofnar it is a premium product from a premium company you dont see people complaining about how expensive rolex watches are
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;strpl2 actually after best buys 150 reduction and trade in with verizoni have an old lg g4 which values at 240  combined thats almost 400 off the samsung bringing it to 590 sorry no comparison
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;miguel angel medina rise note 8 is 960 dollars lol dont bash apple when other companies are doing it first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;strpl2;jackelofnar  so is 960 for the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ECDT1089;as a current iphone 7 user paying 1000 for a phone is ridiculous i wont be upgrading
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dukens Saint Vil;burntoastie not anymore
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;1000 phone better comes with all the possible bands unlocked bootloader and straight out the box root access and a failsafe if anything breaks also a community that would create custom roms for 67 years at least im talking only about android sorry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Lamoa;jackelofnar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;do not buy the iphone x then buy the 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Diego Martinez;food republic how much porn are you downloading that 64 gigs is nowhere enough  ive had my 64 gig phone almost 2 years have 1000s of photos and videos hundreds of apps and i still have 20 gigs left
iPhoneX;MrMobile;starwars551;then dont buy it there are dozens of great phones that are under half that price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DJens;jackelofnar but still it get a lot sales
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nyarukosan787;novak bullshit it doesnt even get android 5 lollipop
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Novak;nyarukosan787 xiaomi first gen mi 1 gets updates right till this day
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ajay raj;admiral ashik ummm what processorall day to day applications which youll use are much more fluid on some phones with 835 than apple eg one plus 5 or htcand whats the point of a so called bionic to make apple fans wet just like that if you cant use it in real life applications for which you use a phone forpeople forget that in the end you are using a mobile only
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Randy Fleet;yea because of the payment plans
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evan Williams;you can change the screen to qhd on the note 8 so you would be incorrect also samsung just announced 4k at 60fps on the note 8 its coming in an update
iPhoneX;MrMobile;King Of Kings;charlie the note 8 just got an update to  4k at 60fps i guess it didnt take long ha so did they reach that level yet how long will it take for apple to catch up to qualcomm level of 960fpslmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;d tech terminal don‚Äôt overwork your already much inferior processor to reduce it‚Äôs already limited lifespan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;admiral ashik buddy im an official developer of resurrection remix and ive made some custom kernels too so i know what im saying if you dont believe just read the link i posted above s8 got a mod to enable 60fps 4k video recording and i knew its possible because i had zuk z1 which didnt came with 1080p 60fps support but we made it possible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;d tech terminal 4k 60fps support by software will google also add water resistance and stereo speaker by software update man you are retarded
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;dark007 look what i said is true httpwwwfirstpostcomtechnewsanalysissamsunggalaxys8cameramodbrings1440p60fpsvideorecordingamongothergoodies3988929html
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abcdefg;magnus vantrum theres actually many more improvements you have to use one to understandi used one yesterday and very impressed but still waiting to see the v30 and pixel 2 lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mar m;iphone sucks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;King Of Kings;charlie when can the a11 do 960fpslol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;charlie okay thats great but do you know google hired a chip engineer to manufacture their own soc and google is even in talks with htc to acquire their cellphone business so in future google wont be a software company which develops android for the phones of other brands theyll have their own hardware and software so things are going to be great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;d tech terminal not a big deal 4k 60fps shows the shear power of the a11 bionic i wonder how long it will take for qualcomm to reach the level apple is at currently fun fact the low cpu core on the a11 bionic is equivalent to the power of one of the high cores in the qualcomm 835
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;dark007  do you know that google added hdr support on pixel and pixel xl just with software its not a very big deal to add 4k 6pfps support by software the main bottleneck will be the overheating i guess otherwise its completely possible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;dark007 yeah but not everyone is an amateur film maker
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;d tech terminal improved its way faster and the camera can do 4k at 60 fps the cheapest camera that can do that costs 2k
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;harrry hrld infinity display that they ship with 1080p default while iphone x has true tone display and qhd making it better display by farit also has portrait on both camera has 4k 60fps 1080p 240 fps neural engine ar capabilities and these are not in note 8 which is only 70 cheaper and iphone also has much better soc by far
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;sachankara in android you need to mod it using xposed edge if there is alot of demand i am sure google will implement it in the next version just like many android improvement that bassically coming from android modding community first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;wait until apple ditching the usb port on the iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;dude youre not gonna buy it anyway youre just a hater and if youre so concerned buy the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sachankara;nokia n9 and blackberry 10 did it alright too it just goes so much faster and smoother to multitask using swipe gestures i had some slight hope for sailfish os and ubuntu touch but i guess the ios will be the first really popular os to embrace it  android will probably not get swipe gestures in the same way its just too limited due to its back button requirement but one can always hope they solve it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;theres no reason they couldnt have bad both  some of the other gestures look painful to do as well
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;kingslayer as an audio lover wireless sucks and i have good wireless ear buds jaybird x3s whoop apples ear ods in terms of sound quality and even though they cost 130 bucks they pale in comparison to the wired single driver shure in ear monitors on amazon for 50 bucks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Blay Blhompson;stanley johnson worse
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;disagree you guys still dont get the value of the headphone jack if you think a home button is as universally modular useful and accessible as a 35mm jack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fawad Bilgrami;its a good idea blackberry did it pretty well with their gestures
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;stanley johnson  do you play for the detroit pistons my brother played against you back in the day  michael fisher is correct as usual he likes things that i like shit i even like star wars and star trek i miss webos swipe to close apps too so naturally satisfying  kid future is going to be wireless just get the airpods and airpower to benefit from it for the playstation 5 are fans asking for wired controllers again move on  üï∏ dont let life get tangled up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ME BL;nah gestures are cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke LaFleur;stanley johnson the gestures sort of remind me of the amazon fire phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];strongly disagree this might be my favorite feature from an interface perspective got so used to flickinguptohome in my palm pre days i loved it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spirus Visuals;well theyre working on fullroom wireless charging so you wont need a pad at all but can just walk into a room and have your devices start charging that way you can use them while they charge and still have no ports
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ciabo69;kingslayer the only difference is that all those controllers come with the purchase buying good wireless headphones is at least 100 dollars and that charging pad is probably going to be around 150 so if u want a device with a charger and a pair of headphones to be well over 1300 then yeah fantastic idea the rest of us will stick with cables  and btw u charge all those remotes with guess what a cable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;youssef fetouh;well we all know that wireless is the future
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DeAnna Hundley;jony ive said his perfect iphone would be a sheet of glass so i can honestly see them removing the charging port in a few generations
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;flandersned good  üï∏  i dont see people asking for wired controllers again on the next playstation or xbox get iphone x apple watch airpods and airpower  charge them all done
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W. L.;and then after 1 or 2 years in dongle hell apple will invent a phone with all the useful ports and features build in innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rick Cs;alden mor yeah and you wont be able to pick it up whike charging  it will be a bad thing and my friend jackless iphone is inconvenient since many times they cant connect to an aux cord or none bluetooth headphones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vegito Blue;flandersned i just feel like sense apple did it they can get away with it but my s8 still stands true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alden Mor;flandersned it won‚Äôt be a bad thing looks how many phones aren‚Äôt using headphone jacks now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alden Mor;kiran addala yes it is first in the industry for 3d facial  you‚Äôre thinking of fav oak recognition it‚Äôs not the same thing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raveen Bikha;simon does it have handoff and continuity
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Simon;at least the note 8 is an excellent phone with highend features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;charlie true but its still the baddest beast on the market unlike the iphone x which is just a competitor to its younger sibling the galaxy s8 not even the s8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie neither was iphone7
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;neither was the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Terty Brown;charlie well im not defending samsung but if you didnt already knowthe s8s cpu can as init actually can shoot video in 4k  120fps but its just samsung didnt let the full performance of the s8 shine in the camera department you can check out websites about that anywayswhy the hell did samsung not allow the full performance of the phone to shine is franklymind blowing imhodisabling this performance is soo stupid and ignorant of themwill samsung actually release a software update that lifts this restriction well never know but anyways the point isif it could shoot 4k slo mo  120fpsimagine the fps captured in 1080p itll probably be 480fps just saying from my theory sinceif the iphone could shoot 4k  60fps and 1080p slo mo  240fps though id like to see the competition respond to this for a more competitive marketoh and i was talking about the exynos model of the s8 not the snapdragon
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vedant Goel;khotta bogard kaguraaaaa
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;charlie those features are really cool no doubt but definitely not worth the price and if youre gonna be shooting those kind of frame rates you need more than 64 gb s of storage which th e iphone x will only have 256 for a much higher price tag so in the end youre paying like hundreds of dollars for doubling the frame rates at those two resolutions
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;slight diference the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portrait lighting on the contrary what is a new feature that the note 8 has brought that weve never seen before the only thing i can think of is dual ois
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kagura Schimizu;for instance almost all of its feature is on android like gesture i mean that feature is on almost any android and android has on screen finger print scanner like vivo phone haha peace
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jenison;more expensive with slight differencehow about the shitty note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;dark007 but ill reply fight me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;khotta bogard cause we want more customization
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;khotta bogard he wont reply cause he just hates on apple has nothing better 2 do in life
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;kagura schimizu describe why its only a slight difference

LGV30;MrMobile;Mihai Lazar;my heart is breaking that even lg ditched removable batterries  you gotta remember tht that phone nomatter how pretty will die in a couple of years becaus its battery has a finite ammount of times it can be charged and discharged  and fast charging only makes it worse  fc is a very very usefull feature  but it shouldnt be the default  especially if the phone will never see another battery than the one its shipped with  there should be a toggle in the notifications asking you if youre in a hurry and need a fast topup  not straining the battery every night by charging it full in 1 hour when you have 9 hours to spare

LGV30;MrMobile;Christopher Smith;the 21 aspect ratio is soooo much better than an 1859its crazy that such a small detail makes such a differencethis one looks like it has much more horizontal area than either s8 ¬†i guess the 21 coupled with the fact that the sides dont curve very much make this look like a much more usable and enjoyable device ¬†i actually thought it was a 169 before the aspect ratio was mentioned

LGV30;MrMobile;Larry Doolittle;thank you for a fabulous review i will check this phone out i have said it before but your home is beautiful i know how much work is in that wonderful home congratulation for having your life so together
LGV30;MrMobile;Rookavio Bishop;i really dont know why but for me the design of v30 looks very ugly boring and not stylish i think the color quality of oled is deceiving me
LGV30;MrMobile;9rmetal;i might get this phone instead of the pixel 2
LGV30;MrMobile;Krishnakumar;i wud say note 8 is an alternative to v30 samsung has lost a lot of fans by making its phone a 1000 phone
LGV30;MrMobile;Liu TinYau;hey michael just wanna ask how is he front camera as you know the one on lgg6 is not good
LGV30;MrMobile;All Videos;lit
LGV30;MrMobile;Xenoz 19;goddammit why did lg ruin this series of phones v10 was the first mobile to impress me in years especially the durability and the second screen it had this amazing texture on the back and was removable as well really liked the double front facing cameras yes it had its problems but the pros exceeded the cons really didnt like the approach the took with the v20 so i waited for the v30 but it turns out that they completely abandoned what made the first phone special and unique instead they made a new phone exactly like these dull flagships like samsungs and apples with the boring back of the phone and the plain simple display
LGV30;MrMobile;ThatWeirdAlex;i miss my v10 tbh but i have the iphone 7 plus now
LGV30;MrMobile;Xenebrius;this phone makes my dick rock hard
LGV30;MrMobile;one and a half gamer;the v30 has poled screen not amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;JPNox;v30 seems to be lauded as an amazing phone for audio but you probably cant take headphones off though can get tiring  too bad nobody does decent front speakers in 2017 anymore need a new phone but everything feels like a downgrade in this aspect coming from one e8
LGV30;MrMobile;Titus Judah;theres still a party in the back üòÇüòÜüòÖ
LGV30;MrMobile;Velizar Milutinovic;for all of you who cant wait to buy it keep in mind that there is a huge difference between water resistant and waterproof

LGV30;MrMobile;Strofi Kornego;boring nobody is going to update  there is nothing new
LGV30;MrMobile;Vince Liu;where is the power button on this phone i know it has a finger print sensor on the black and volume buttons on the side but how do you initially switch the phone on without a power button also if somehow in the future you need to do a factory reset sequence where is the power button

LGV30;MrMobile;InaBindProductions;looks great with great features

LGV30;MrMobile;Murzik Line;like it any better than note 8s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Abhishek Giri;wow  its beautiful in every possible way but i dun knw y i have to watch ur videos wen i hav already watched it on 5 other channels on the same product
LGV30;MrMobile;Shis Chougule;i am presently using nexus 6p now that we have v30 out what should i go for v30 s8 note8 or wait for pixel
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;when you do the review please please make sure to comment on the audio including the speaker set up if its another mono speaker thats going to be really frustrating to me after htc showed the world even without front facing chassis one can use the earpiece as a speaker it just seems so totally weak at this point just to have a single bottom firing speaker when that option exists to great effect dual front facing is superior but im pretty happy with my htc 10 and the u11 is even better but the u11 has no headphone jack so its dead to me   im really hoping for good speakers on the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;hausofemm;i really like how smooth your animations run on your videos simple and clean üëç
LGV30;MrMobile;Christian Chavez;this video was top notch
LGV30;MrMobile;wascar G;i think both apple and samsung have to be knee shaking right now  this phone is a must have
LGV30;MrMobile;manoj mondal;i like smartphones with large displays thats why i like lg v30 more than samsung galaxy s8 plus or note 8 because the dual curved edges of samsung flagship phones shorten the display but lg has done a great job by  producing an infinity oled 6 inch  display without reducing the screen size
LGV30;MrMobile;Bojan Schmeker;need a stylus and im ditching note
LGV30;MrMobile;CWI Productions;gonna miss the metal monster but i love my lg g6 and ill love this v30üòç
LGV30;MrMobile;manoj mondal;this is one of the best hands on videos in fact all your videos are amazing mrmobile specially i like your reviews of smartphones
LGV30;MrMobile;Dj Gelo Official;poled not amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;Patrik Miskovic;mate 10  v30 and note 8 best 3 phone in 2017

LGV30;MrMobile;awakenosiris;whats in the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;Oscar Cooke-Abbott;holy crap i never cared about a secondary wideangle lens despite many techies endorsing it until you showed that circular buildingsky shot
LGV30;MrMobile;Sujoy Dhawa;once subscribed will never unsubscribe
LGV30;MrMobile;Neil Dillette;looks very nice i especially like where the finger print scanner is it has its own space away from the camera and looks very easy to reach
LGV30;MrMobile;Pratik Saha;watching this on my v20
LGV30;MrMobile;raze;any word on the audio amp and dac
LGV30;MrMobile;Bankhead 1;the water resistance already isnt as good
LGV30;MrMobile;Bobby Jay;its gorgeous i would choose the v30 over the note8
LGV30;MrMobile;M. Sami;course not cheap
LGV30;MrMobile;Vineesh VN;led notification light
LGV30;MrMobile;KeybladeScar;lg v30 and lg g6 üòçüòç
LGV30;MrMobile;Jeffrey Chow;note 8 is better even the korean knows
LGV30;MrMobile;Infinit3Enigma;looks nice but idk i was expecting more ill hold out till pricing but if its over 899 id still get a note 8imo
LGV30;MrMobile;TheAxb2010;why does this guy look and sound so familiar
LGV30;MrMobile;Piyath Alawatte;lg did a great job now lg must promote this device by advertising and by various promotions like samsung does for note 8 i think lg should announce a promo saying that if someone return a working lg g6 g5 g4 or any galaxy s5 s6 s7 or note 45  theyll receive up to 400 discount from this devices original price when they buy the v30 or something very tempting like that  they have to do that if they want to sell this in millions they just have to
LGV30;MrMobile;Ramy G;does it overheat like every other lg phone
LGV30;MrMobile;sid 123;can you plz do a review on the nokia 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Beastly G;wow lg well fin done
LGV30;MrMobile;greenranger2482;beautiful phone i have the s8 but this one looks really good
LGV30;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;this is the first time lg actually competed head on with samsung in terms of hardware and software design and quality and this is exactly where i felt lg was lacking in the previous generations great job lg definitely looking forward to this over the note8 especially since the dual camera features are industrys best and the audio game is top notch and its also packing an oled screen just a magnificent product
LGV30;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;258 love how mr fisher set the girls ass as the subject to demonstrate the following zoom dope feature tho
LGV30;MrMobile;Paul Timothy Lavado;this seems to be better than the note 8 though both of their softwares sucks
LGV30;MrMobile;Waylander;price will be 750
LGV30;MrMobile;Alex Capo;love it
LGV30;MrMobile;Alexander Espinal;lgs steppin it uppppp
LGV30;MrMobile;Lil Joker;the problem with lg is that they dont have a good reputation most of their phones suffer from eventual bootloop no support after an year and horrible resale value the ui looks extremely old as well if lg didnt have all these issues it could actually compete with samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;James# English;hi mrmobile michael fisher i see you your video at first time thanks you for your video see a next video
LGV30;MrMobile;Dilwale cricket;can any of you recommend a phone with max price of 250300 max  big screen 4 gb ram good processor atleast full hd screen  thanks in advance  i am really intrigued by lg v10 i can buy a brand new one for under 200 but i am scared of boot loop any advice  or v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Slowro;is it weird you didnt mention the headphone jack
LGV30;MrMobile;Gergely Urb√°n;not amoled ist poled
LGV30;MrMobile;Earl Lacefield;great video like always something i would like to see more is a little more focus on the speakers does this have stereo speakers or single bottom fire speaker
LGV30;MrMobile;eug3nius;almost no v20 owner will upgrade and the v10 was the best looking v
LGV30;MrMobile;Aliff Suhaimi;you forgot to mention that the v30 still have a headphone jack add that with the lg builtin dac this phone is best for the headphone users
LGV30;MrMobile;Wilfredo Barrett;stunningly beautiful and powerful finally lg at the top where it should be hopefully huawei and xiaomi let them enjoy their moment of fame for some time oh yes iphone and pixel are yet to come great video thumbs up
LGV30;MrMobile;TheWatermelonfruits;my v10 broke got some demigod crash or something lg said they couldnt do anything about it so im not going to buy another lg phone anymore good phone though but only accompany me for 17 months
LGV30;MrMobile;anujgadre;have to decide between samsung galaxy 8 or lg v30 should i wait for the lg or go buy samsung camera is my prime requirement and the audio 2nd
LGV30;MrMobile;eduardo evangelio;v30 is cool and essential in many ways üòâ

LGV30;MrMobile;CaptainAshra;that on the fly color grading is something i never would have thought i wanted in a phone but now i cant think of a reason not to have it  from the settings ive seen they look awesome and not at all overdone ii need this phone
LGV30;MrMobile;cromeaxe;i gonna get this for sure
LGV30;MrMobile;Shobin Drogan;lg is the only phone company that im interested in the products right now all others are either doing something stupid or have giant bezels

LGV30;MrMobile;Agung Setyanto;rip note 8 v30 is the best now
LGV30;MrMobile;David M;phone of the year
LGV30;MrMobile;dddslimebbb;tbh the v20 had what took to take over the note 7 market after they started blowing up but it didnt the recent problem with lg is no longer quality but marketing on another note would i be right to say theres no removable battery seems like a step backwards but i guess water resistance is an even trade off for it camera quality seems like it will be a huge improvement the dynamic range of the v20 is pretty awful imo also hows the audio quality i bought the v20 specifically for the dac which is amazing
LGV30;MrMobile;Jesse Wood;you forgot band 71
LGV30;MrMobile;Ethical Guru;httpsyoutubescpnc5v4zga lg v 30 unboxing vedio please watch it

LGV30;MrMobile;Dean Haeder;wish it wasnt so hard to find a good phone this one is damn near perfect but missing stereo speakers definitely not a multimedia powerhouse without those guess ill have to hope the pixel 2xl doesnt disappoint  great preview as always michael
LGV30;MrMobile;SlenderMarc;fuck it has a headphone jack not buying it thats a step backwards
LGV30;MrMobile;Max Youshimatz;so lgs pitch is we finally cought up to the competition but with an ugly looking interface  im going to pass on this one and wait for the s9

LGV30;MrMobile;Luis Padilla;will the lg v30 have googles stock android emojis instead of lgs own emojis
LGV30;MrMobile;Jeremy Hinds;am i the only one that thinks this thing is very meh people looking for a samsung alternative in a phone that looks almost exactly like an s8 and has a slightly less curved screen cool cameras a little different but whats the point feel like lg dropped the ball
LGV30;MrMobile;The Blacked IPs;you took 4 minutes to say well basically another samsung clone hits the market wheres the wow factor does it have secondary screen no infrared blaster no removable battery no better specs than other phones no completely touchless voice commands and controls no fingerprint resistant back no 35mm headphone jack no low light camera no no no no etc  and most of these features were from the v20 why do we need the phone to be longer but thinner again right so it bends inside our pockets and we need a new one nice
LGV30;MrMobile;Aaron Chris;looks nice
LGV30;MrMobile;David Hicks;i love lg phones and my v20 and wow i cant wait to buy this one lg put alot into this one

LGV30;MrMobile;Ricardo117;throw google now lunches on it and youre ready to go
LGV30;MrMobile;Costa Filho;the only reason for me to prefer the s7 over the g6 is the low light performance love the wide angle but i cant stand to the poor low light performance of the g6 hopefully it is better on the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;Mujtaba Ibrahim;this is the first time in a long time i want to buy an expensive phone i think this deserves the price tag

LGV30;MrMobile;Rhett Vincent;can anyone recommend a camera app that has the same color grading feature while capturing video thatd be a dream cheers
LGV30;MrMobile;Betternet;too bad theyll market it like a 100 budget phone all theyll do is hire joseph gordon levit for a half assed ad and call it a day
LGV30;MrMobile;Abe;lg has to market and promote the hell out of this device if they want to take the light from samsung samsung and apple excel in mareting which lg lacks sure lg makes solid phones but they arent able to market it to the masses

LGV30;MrMobile;Nikolay Bonapartov;i think i am gonna buy this phone if its under 700 i am sure google pixel 2 will be better but i am also certain itll cost 9001000 which is a bit too much for me
LGV30;MrMobile;Ryan T;so all they did is make the g6 but slightly better at least the previous v series added something the g series didnt have i hate when manufactures do this
LGV30;MrMobile;Andres Perez;its just another g6  0 innovation in design i guess im going for the note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Last Night;lg really took notes from samsung ü§îü§î none the less great looking phone

LGV30;MrMobile;Batman;it looks exactly like an s8 from the front
LGV30;MrMobile;You are breathing;i think i might get the v30 since i dont like the curved edges of the screen on the samsung phones if it somehow breaks im still weary about lgs longevity i can just go back to my nokia 6 or get another cheap android phone
LGV30;MrMobile;animesh singh;hi mrmobile i am ur big fan but ur voice quality was not good this timenot sure why
LGV30;MrMobile;Paul Facemire;so glad they decided to get rid if the 2nd screen  the light bleed around that thing is atrocious
LGV30;MrMobile;Karim Sadouni;my frand  have l g help  happy
LGV30;MrMobile;Strigal dvir;if you like second screen check meizu pro 7 plus
LGV30;MrMobile;Chris S;ill stick with my g5 but i love where lg is going with its phones  if the g6 had this screen and processor it wouldve been much more competitive  next time i do buy im looking hard at the v series  you are still the best tech vlogger out there

LGV30;MrMobile;Adri√°n Kereky;the phones of the 2017 look perfects with all the tech advancesthe question is how will be the 2018 smartphones mor perfection
LGV30;MrMobile;shashwat panda;call it my g6 bias but i honestly feel when it comes to how a phone looks and feels imo lg has nailed it this time with the g6 and v30 absolute stunners to look at
LGV30;MrMobile;–¶–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–º–µ—Ç–∞–ª–ª–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫;401 if you want mr mobile videos to keep landing in urine box wait what
LGV30;MrMobile;Saul Nunez;well this is the first flagship ive been excited in a while
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin Parker;how is the battery
LGV30;MrMobile;Mahin Alam Emon;i think i will get the lg v30 after 2 year when its price comes down
LGV30;MrMobile;Fredrik Stenholm;oh man next year looks like im switching from s8 to v40
LGV30;MrMobile;KHGlass;this is probably an unpopular opinion but the v30s back looks pretty ugly not taking away from its other attributes but purely aesthetically this doesnt appeal to me as much as the note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Ahmad Talat;definitely an lg fan boy now and this is an amazing phone love it
LGV30;MrMobile;BearShepherd;whay about front camera meeehhhh
LGV30;MrMobile;TheSpector;too bad the phone looks so much as samsung galaxy
LGV30;MrMobile;Sam I;stopped watching after seeing 4gb ram üò£
LGV30;MrMobile;Chathura Lakmal;i want secondary screen back
LGV30;MrMobile;TheSpector;this will be my next phone if my xperia z3 dies in me one year gone hopefully many years to go
LGV30;MrMobile;Blake Alan Mihavics;im a videographer but i dont think ill be getting the v30 anytime soon
LGV30;MrMobile;Marco Melendres;i havent even held this thing on my hands yet but i love it hopefully the software doesnt kill this thing
LGV30;MrMobile;officialpartychannel;the audio is a bit pitchy
LGV30;MrMobile;Aimeryl Mat;259  305 mr mobile was zoomtracking that ass i see
LGV30;MrMobile;jerry caughron;i hated the v10
LGV30;MrMobile;Apti Newim;whats the music
LGV30;MrMobile;Cameron GGU;guess what my alternative to the note7 was when it failed a v20 the worst decision of my life the back panels aluminum lost its color and the camera shattered every little drop the phone took the back plate flew off and the battery came out the software was sluggish and i found my phone often overheating the batterys quality dropped significantly over less than a year compared to my previous samsung devices here i am today still with this device as it dies at 15 thats an issue i dont see for years in samsung devices in fact i still have my note5 and it has absolutely no battery issues whatsoever the screen on the v20 although its an lcd and this is v30 is going to be amoled had major screen burnin issues especially while using the gboard keyboard the screen however was extremely durable in fact to show this i was playing basketball and my stuff was in a grass field behind the hoop there was an iphone se at the bottom with a wallet on top of it and then my v20 on top of that the v20 took a direct shot from the basketball flew up and landed face down on the concrete i was worried about it but the screen was perfectly fine when i checked the iphonr however even with the layers of protection it was completely shattered thats something that would be really good for the v20 is a similar quality screen however if the glass on the back is anything like the glass from the v20 camera glass you are looking at a shattered back every time you drop the device my verdict is that im not going to trust lg this year sorry guys just not for me ill check out the pixel 2 im not sold on the note 8 either
LGV30;MrMobile;M B;hope i will see you in berlin on sunday and have one picture together respect for your work
LGV30;MrMobile;Jonathan Wade;if the v30 had an iris scannersamsung would be left in the dust
LGV30;MrMobile;zodiacfml;finally something compelling from lg im not comfortable with the still small camera sensor though  i am quite wary when he compared it to the note 8 i hope this isnt going to be too expensive  current price of an s8 is reasonable to me
LGV30;MrMobile;mickyeverton;many thanks peace from london üëçüëç
LGV30;MrMobile;Chad Weaver;release date
LGV30;MrMobile;DavidvsGoliath2.0;will definitely trade my beautiful g6 for this beautiful v30
LGV30;MrMobile;iMiguelAOG;i hate how its being called 189 21 is much simpler
LGV30;MrMobile;Arka Bose;please do not say your inbox that quickly it felt like u were saying urine box
LGV30;MrMobile;bentley TRAN;im using the g6 right now and loving it cant wait to buy the v30 i guess im a lg guy now
LGV30;MrMobile;Nick Myrant;i like that he‚Äôs already surpassing the verge as videos when they come out the verge always beats him by a hair but michael gets more views and likes and he deserves it üëç
LGV30;MrMobile;Michael G;lg and sammy are killing it üëè
LGV30;MrMobile;Tiga;looks good
LGV30;MrMobile;ilisan;why is nobody exicted about the log profile maybe the samsungs are still better allrounders but lg got me with the video features
LGV30;MrMobile;dev sengupta;i was rooting for nokia 8 but i think ill be buying the v30 the nokia 8 is beautiful no doubt but this phone managed to be water proof as well which the nokia 8 isnt
LGV30;MrMobile;P4boot;lg is the only company that seems to get it right nowadays lets see if theyll get the price right
LGV30;MrMobile;Scott M;ugh a headphone jack  ill pass
LGV30;MrMobile;TheHotStuff;op5  galaxy s8  v30
LGV30;MrMobile;elvistwatty;only if they had the marketing budget samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Arturo Cesar;a lot of people at ifa are saying the phone looks great and has all the specs to make it a true flagship but that it feels cheap not to mention that the 16 aperture wont truly shine with the mediocre sensor being used these are silly mistakes on lgs part ill wait for release and hope the reviews convince me to get this phone because i was really looking forward to it
LGV30;MrMobile;Red Hood;is it just me or it looks like an s8
LGV30;MrMobile;a e;this is what the pixel 2 xl will look like both have the 6 inch amoled 1440p screen and shape the pixel xl 2 will have a metal back
LGV30;MrMobile;themessiah809;oh look another company copying samsung thats just what we needed a bigger lg g6 with a mix of s8 in the front now let me go order an note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;stereomatch;this device is capable of hires audio  can you put up some audio recording samples  at 32bit192khz or thereabouts  using the builtin audio recorder or use our recorder amazing mp3 recorder
LGV30;MrMobile;Marney Olson;that is slick
LGV30;MrMobile;fbcpraise;in that full review be sure to talk about the dac
LGV30;MrMobile;Hettor MachCesar;failed flagships of 2017  xperia xz1 and rest of the same models with different sizes  htc hold my beer u11

LGV30;MrMobile;Muaz Shuaib;forgot to mention the amazing quad hifi dac
LGV30;MrMobile;dmsanx;lg 30 looking good
LGV30;MrMobile;asif zzaman;its odd how such lg masterpieces go right under the radar
LGV30;MrMobile;Mutingun Amun;so now most flagship look like s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Samantha Erika McKee;i need to save for this
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Duarte;if you want mrmobile videos to keep landing in urine box was what i heard at first at 402
LGV30;MrMobile;Brown86Power;v30 plus coming

LGV30;MrMobile;Matthew Warren;why cant we get a 4000 mah battery üôÑüôÑüôÑ
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Sorrell;pretty decent phone upgrade in 2 months might have found the winner

LGV30;MrMobile;Tomy Budi Abadi;5mp fcüòÇ
LGV30;MrMobile;scupking;this is the best looking phone on the market cant stand the curved edges and the even taller screen ratio on samsung phones
LGV30;MrMobile;Tomasz S≈Çoniowski;cant wait for the full review
LGV30;MrMobile;JUNIORFAKE;why not 68 gigs of ram lg
LGV30;MrMobile;Omar Axel Rodriguez Martinez;does the next pixel will look like tihis
LGV30;MrMobile;ankit suthar;will the floating bar feature be added to lg g6 units
LGV30;MrMobile;gothamtyler;was gonna wait for the pixel 2 but idk now lg looks like they finally did it
LGV30;MrMobile;Phillip Morales;so does this have a quad dac
LGV30;MrMobile;Jay Maqsood;this will likely be cheaper so if thats a priority then this is it note8 in my view is so much better looking thats not important to everyone i understand i personally dont like how v30 looks it looks so outdated like an iphone with thinner bezel i really do want these videorecording related features and upgrades though very conflicted at the moment im dumping my iphone and cant decide if i should wait for this or just bite the bullet and keep my note8 preorder
LGV30;MrMobile;Yvonne's Vlogs;a phone ill never have because i simply cant afford one
LGV30;MrMobile;dranzerbeast0308;smooth transition into the sponsorship as usual
LGV30;MrMobile;ankur saspal;how much money did lg gave you to say lg g30 can compete with note8  are you for real
LGV30;MrMobile;aldeen1982;is d brand sponsoring every fu video on the internet
LGV30;MrMobile;Random Thoughts;bootloop king is back with b 30
LGV30;MrMobile;cineRAMA;with those not so cheap prices these companies are losing their minds waiting for the affordable xiaomi mi mix 2 that offers the same specs at half the price üí≤
LGV30;MrMobile;Stefos;make a review with a lot details
LGV30;MrMobile;Juve S;absolutely the best alternative to samsung flagships the new screen  upgraded specs and most of all the cameras on this bad boy make it a complete standout imo this is definitely on the short list of my next phone list as an lg g6 user this wouldnt be a surprise as i love the g6 im just hopeful lg can keep this up and really become a force against apple and samsung the more competitive it gets amongst them the better it will be for us thanks mrmobile
LGV30;MrMobile;Lukasz Matwiejczyk;love it have s8 plus and will order this one as soon is out
LGV30;MrMobile;bassistdc;headphone jack is good to have but single speaker and high price is not good
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;neeeeeeeeeet the v30 does not have amoled its poled which is technically the same as in their tv lineup
LGV30;MrMobile;TJ;you had me at amoled take my money
LGV30;MrMobile;Dennis Watkins;will be my next phone slightly used lg g6 for sale hah hah
LGV30;MrMobile;ecb116;does it have an ir blaster so that it can be used as a universal  remote control
LGV30;MrMobile;InvisiMan;repeat after me the v30 is not an alternative to the note 8  it might be an alternative to the s8 but not the note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Kingslayer;that looks better my g5 and v20 showed image retention after 4 months can see it in grayish background my g5 is also now showing lightbleed near the top lg used crap displays last year wasnt planning to get this because nomore ir blaster and removable change of plans  but wait about march to get it heavily discounted lg prices drops faster
LGV30;MrMobile;itz willow;the s8 and note 8 got real competition
LGV30;MrMobile;Preeyen Mistry;love my v20 probably going to keep it till it dies then pick up the latest vxx solid phones and feature packed
LGV30;MrMobile;Prashanth Murali;143 could it look like the s8 any more
LGV30;MrMobile;Guillermo Gonzalez;always a delight to see your reviews the v30 is precious
LGV30;MrMobile;ZuluFox;this or oneplus 5
LGV30;MrMobile;Deathstroke 87;but will it bootloop üòè
LGV30;MrMobile;Menno.H;my face went from üòê to ü§§ at 200 üòÇ
LGV30;MrMobile;Brik Haus;but what about the dac did that get upgraded or at least left the same
LGV30;MrMobile;Luis J;259 dat ass
LGV30;MrMobile;Kamilar135;i would prefer it any day over the ugly brick note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;TheChemist;pet peeve i have with v20 is 5mp front facing camera and they are still opting for 5mp yet againi guess i will just stick to v20 for now
LGV30;MrMobile;LZ;awesome first time i would consider an lg phone freaking oled yes with the times
LGV30;MrMobile;Umer Ahmed;thank you so much for the early handson review
LGV30;MrMobile;mango091;does it bootloop
LGV30;MrMobile;He- Man;that looks soooo gorgeous üòçüòç
LGV30;MrMobile;AxxxelRudi;im waiting for this phone for soooo long
LGV30;MrMobile;Can we get 10 000 subscribers with no videos;can we do it
LGV30;MrMobile;Darrell Jared;hen you rocking an alcatel one touch pop c1 and see all these amazing and powerful phones being released lool
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniil Gerasimov;idk im kinda disappointed i own v20 and love this phone because of its unique designkinda like iphones in a sense beside design i like it for unique features such as removable battery best sound quality on a market and dual screen which is super convenient but now new one looks like g6 it doesnt have dual screen anymore and idk if they kept other unique features its too early to say but i dont know what would make me to choose v30 over v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Tertia Musidora;this is a great phone but the sales of this phone will be the same like lgs previous phone if lg dont step up in their marketing effort üòíüòí
LGV30;MrMobile;Victor Smith;no matter how good lg makes a phone they will always be overlooked
LGV30;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;this is perfect whats more pefect is that it will devalue greatly in just 1 year i wont be surprised if the price goes down to 450 in the second quarter of next years i love you lg i found the flat edged replacement for my s7 edge
LGV30;MrMobile;ZenPowerBuilder;may have just found an upgrade for my s7 flat  cant wait to see your full review
LGV30;MrMobile;Santos Ventura;damn what a beautiful smartphone
LGV30;MrMobile;Ahmad Alturki;so you cant remove the back enymore üò¢
LGV30;MrMobile;Mizan Choudhury;it is sad that it hasnt got a niche to it to separate it from the g series
LGV30;MrMobile;Yaman Lalpurwala;what about the dac
LGV30;MrMobile;wascar G;wow this might be it that zoom in feature is amazing
LGV30;MrMobile;lIFLUDDIl;can someone answer this should i keep my g6 or should i pay the extra 250 and get the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;Lucas Zelitt;no romovable battery  no buy love my lgv20
LGV30;MrMobile;LeBeautiful;ahhhh v series great phone
LGV30;MrMobile;AwesomeShitCentral;nice e46 coupe at 002
LGV30;MrMobile;tonybabdos17;well done lg
LGV30;MrMobile;Salty der Regenmacher;s8 copy lmfao
LGV30;MrMobile;SavageArfad;has a nice camera but wait for the price there‚Äôs also the fingerprint sensor placement the poor enough bottom facing speaker and it doesn‚Äôt come with oreo which it should the quad dac wasn‚Äôt that impressive on the v6 feels light in the hand from reports
LGV30;MrMobile;Mike Bird;v30 is sick gona have to scoop one up asap
LGV30;MrMobile;De'Rajon Slaughter;does it come in black
LGV30;MrMobile;Jesus Meza;v30 looks too much like the s8 with its more rounded corners
LGV30;MrMobile;Captain Cold;seems like i got my g6 to soon cause this v30 is gorgeous oh well still happy with the g6 the most reliable android phone i owned yet at the time the pixel was already over half a year old so it wouldnt be a smart bet for a 2 year contract and ive never been to keen on samsung phones the other brands never really caught my full attention so the g6 was the only logical answer but all together i really enjoy where lg is heading in the phone market back to basics and real innovation 189 crazy screen to body ratios actual beauty and simplicity in hard and software cant wait for an in dept camera review
LGV30;MrMobile;Jose Garza;why should i care about how my phone loos from the back when any reasonable person is just going to put a case no removable battery no buy from me
LGV30;MrMobile;Roman Min√°rik;this is beast rip note8 welcome v30
LGV30;MrMobile;flibbertigibbet gaming;did anyone hear he said urine box at the end
LGV30;MrMobile;japzone;looks like a good alternative for people bummed that the note 8 doesnt support tmobiles 600mhz spectrum v30 is the first phone out of the gate to support 600mhz
LGV30;MrMobile;MrKodanNche;thats more like it lg i love how beautiful it is
LGV30;MrMobile;Daegan AM;nooooo i told myself i wouldnt get another phone this year because the g6 is so good but v30 is so perfect
LGV30;MrMobile;Bonedatt;at some point people will realize that the only alternative to a galaxy note is another galaxy note the spen defines the note series not the screen specs or design no other manufacturer including lg seems to want to seriously compete against samsung in this segment mr mobile and other reviewers will do well to stop saying the v series is an alternative to a galaxy note tossing in any stylus too doesnt make it a worthy competitor a competitor maybe but not a worthy one the v30 has the potential of being a worthy competitor if lg included a stylus with serious productivity software this is where they should take the v series in my opinion
LGV30;MrMobile;Joao Ramos;nobody makes videos like michael fisher  every single one is just great
LGV30;MrMobile;Matthew Bullard;i thought the phone would have some spicy features to make it stand out against the note 8 but it doesnt gusse ill wait for the google pixel 2 at least that phone stands out
LGV30;MrMobile;John Smith;my experience with lg phones has not been good they just dont last
LGV30;MrMobile;MadMike41;ill still have the note8 but this phone is pretty nice
LGV30;MrMobile;Heavy Palmz;my v20 was great but i think the g6 scared me away from lg the screen broke in my pocket in an otterbox other than that i love the phone but i thought it was supposed to be durable at least enough to survive a pair of skinny jeans
LGV30;MrMobile;Mohanraj Nataraj;i have an iphone 7 and would definetely switch to his phone if it had longer software update cycles
LGV30;MrMobile;lorenzo;if it only had dual speakers
LGV30;MrMobile;Charismatic Batman;i missed the removable battery thobut this phone still better than anything else out thr too sad if people still wont notice this phone
LGV30;MrMobile;John Smith;oled
LGV30;MrMobile;Debu Mahato;i love it
LGV30;MrMobile;loost68;what amazes me about your videos is who semantically brilliant youre
LGV30;MrMobile;mureaper;258 loool thought he was gonna zoom on dat thicc ass and then i saw the guitarist xd
LGV30;MrMobile;Ramil Derogongun;am i the only one who think lg g6 and v20 are prettier hopefully it looks great in person like v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Royaler Clash;so whats that httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvskjwbj7tujw
LGV30;MrMobile;Ty EC;dayum this phone looks like my silver s8       i love it
LGV30;MrMobile;Bason Journe157;so here i am after watching watching hands on by android authority danny winget  and pocketnow im finally here saving the best for last
LGV30;MrMobile;ND DYW303;ive been waiting for this review  so excited
LGV30;MrMobile;DANIEL  Root;it is a gorgeous phone but it is not enough for me im definitely getting the note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;v30 vs note 8 vs pixel 2  one of these i will get  i will wait for pixel 2 for final decision  goodbye the overrated crappy fruit company  and welcome android
LGV30;MrMobile;rykim514;man thats a beautiful phone lg should really make this in to a audiophiles dream phone which it pretty much is have a damn good music player audio recording software damn good camera and people will eat this up like crazy
LGV30;MrMobile;Kshitij Shah;amazing review
LGV30;MrMobile;Ian Harvey;i actually liked the other secondary displays as they were in my opinion nonobtrusive i could pretty much get a widget similar to this virtual secondary display however i am so glad that this phone has an oled panel rather than an lcd
LGV30;MrMobile;LucaS RodrigueS „ÉÑ;that phone is good but the volvo already has the v40 so
LGV30;MrMobile;Viczan Art Glass;no removable battery v20 is my last lg
LGV30;MrMobile;Andio-GAMER 201561;fuck the iphone 8 and go with this the best smartphone in entire world now
LGV30;MrMobile;longlostpotato ._.;s8v30
LGV30;MrMobile;yogissjKaio;wow with the superb camera its a brilliant phone but note 8 has stylus otherwise lg v30 is an awesome phone if there was only a stylus
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Edin;looks tremendously good i just wish there was a proper power button on the side sure there is double tap to wake but combined with smart lock having a side power button is handy
LGV30;MrMobile;Filipe Mateus;the real lg g6 plus
LGV30;MrMobile;Minjaniq;first lg phone that i like
LGV30;MrMobile;SPL2;just a bit better lg g6 not a whole lot of diffrrence and still has that 5mp front facing camera well see if its as awful as the g6s front facing camera is
LGV30;MrMobile;creative planet;better than the gimmicky note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;TechPimp;its not an amoled display is an oled display which is better the 2nd screen is built in to the always on display an improved quad dac  also why didnt you tell us about the plus version if it when it is coming out
LGV30;MrMobile;Bugdroid;need to wait for the 6gb of ram version
LGV30;MrMobile;Rushikesh Tade;i dont understand why dont people buy lg
LGV30;MrMobile;ThatGreekGeek;amoled and wide ange lenses so why would anyone pick the galaxy s8 over this i think lg for the first time nailed it
LGV30;MrMobile;Yamil;ok mr mobile you win i have subscribed üòä
LGV30;MrMobile;LedHead;how are we comparing this to note it blows the purposeless note out of the park
LGV30;MrMobile;Saitej Amonkar;üòÇüòÇüòÇurine boxdid anyone here this other than me
LGV30;MrMobile;Kimoon Nam;ui is horrible dated too much
LGV30;MrMobile;TurkishChubs;i would buy it because it doesnt have a bixby button
LGV30;MrMobile;Rheaanne;why are lg phones always so ugly üòë
LGV30;MrMobile;Kevin Vel√°squez;the note 8 is shit in comparison with this beast
LGV30;MrMobile;Free Your Mind;a g6 with an amoled screen given how prices on lg phone drop the v30 seems to be even better than the s8
LGV30;MrMobile;DCUOxDestro;i still dont get why the ffc is only 5mp what lens does it use selfies on the g6 are super blurry and i hope its not the case with this beauty
LGV30;MrMobile;Kou Takumi;damnit why i freaking want it damnit omg i only get samsungs for the oled screen but now that this change is there idk ifkughsfdguasas
LGV30;MrMobile;Adil Alkanzy;its an oled not an amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;Dan Brisebois;wow my next phone all the way
LGV30;MrMobile;Joshua Sullivan;im hyped for this
LGV30;MrMobile;Devon Calixte;the lg v30 is absolutely beautiful what a complete difference from the lg g6 i dont know why lg company didnt do better display which is amoled display now which is amazing and better gorilla glass and put all the camera features in one place and new features for camera and they could have put all that on the lg g6 in the first place which would have made it better then it is now but the lg v30 has all that and takes it to another level and i love the v series
LGV30;MrMobile;BigVar215;good bye ir blaster üò¢ good bye battery üîã swapping üò¢
LGV30;MrMobile;Marcus Fields;this has to be the best v series ever gotta grab one
LGV30;MrMobile;Forflies;i enjoyed this video so much that even though im already subscribed i tried to subscribe again at the end of this video by accident
LGV30;MrMobile;Saullo Paredes;im not a big lg fan but i think this will be the best lg smartphone ever
LGV30;MrMobile;Rogerie Patricio;every flagship phone nowadays are almost the same so the deciding factor is the brand trust i decided not to buy lg phones due to bootloop issues thats why i always ended up buying samsung phones
LGV30;MrMobile;Marshmallow920;watching this on my v20
LGV30;MrMobile;felixthemaster1;at first i thought it was just copying the s8 a bit too closely but then i realised its only an improvement from the g6 and if they were copying they wouldnt be that obvious about it if only these phones kept the headphone ports so i could be tempted to leave the samsung family
LGV30;MrMobile;Roopa Sharma;i only used to see pocketnow for michael fisher i found you again üòä
LGV30;MrMobile;JaySee5;highly doubt this is amoled likely poled
LGV30;MrMobile;Peaceoo8;i would buy this phone but have major apprehensions due to the infamous boot looping
LGV30;MrMobile;.:T0X1CV01D:.;well that sucks the nice thing about the v phones was the removable battery and the high quality materials if i wanted a glass phone that will brake id buy the g6 lg lost me with this one
LGV30;MrMobile;Skyfather Green;lg gonna mop up samsuck with this one
LGV30;MrMobile;Pety;the s8 my have beat out the g6 but the v30 seems like its taking down the note 8 this round
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin nikku;rip samsung nt8üëè lg g6 v30 trending
LGV30;MrMobile;Nathan Drake;not buying an lg phone ever again i got the lg v20 and i loved it but the screen got screen burningghost image i had to get rid of it i sold it got myself the xiaomi mi mix and i couldnt be happier the battery life is amazing on the mix and i cant wait to get the mix 2
LGV30;MrMobile;David Borromeo;never been this smartphonecamera excited since lumia 1020s depth of field supremacy smartphone category of course and no portrait mode does not count as true depth of field
LGV30;MrMobile;Akhil Sirpur;another lg v series phone that never gets updates ü§¶
LGV30;MrMobile;Rakesh Botadkar Saiman Bobbypins;thats one sweet phone michael cant wait for the full review bigfan
LGV30;MrMobile;BKG Banzai;they ruined what i like about lg compared to other flagship phone makers rugged and tougher phones that and i love second screeni can see how they made that more efficient but the glass build is a clear indicator they are giving up their identity for their v series üò•
LGV30;MrMobile;Hughesy Tech;be aware that you can shoot log on phones like iphone se and above using apps such as filmic pro
LGV30;MrMobile;Zac VanVeen;i really want lg to do well in the smartphone world they have awesome phones its just their skin on android always throws off hardcore android enthusiasts imo
LGV30;MrMobile;Mr Valenzuela;no removable back üò¢ plus looks like a g6 guess ill get the v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Laddi Dhiman;perfect phone üòç
LGV30;MrMobile;Kshitij Kumar;this phone is not gonna sell because of the software
LGV30;MrMobile;Zac VanVeen;when theirs 20 v30 videos in my subfeed i always start with mr mobile keep up the quality my dude
LGV30;MrMobile;GameMaster A9;love this mans vids first one i watch for everything
LGV30;MrMobile;Dexter;what do you guys think about overclocking smartphone is it worth to do if old phone works very slow
LGV30;MrMobile;oceanic16;bootloop
LGV30;MrMobile;R Schroeder;looks like lg did it the v30 looks phenomenal great hands on video michael llap

LGV30;MrMobile;Peter Ford;amoled  fine more glass back ehh dont care ya know kinda wishing for say carbon fiber backs or something different tired of glass constantly acting anew looks like a nice advancement but im sure it wont overthrow the samsung kings s s and will no doubt take a back seat to the note 8and ad usual with lg no front stereo speakers oh well another 800 dollar fancy camera just now with amoled thanks mike

LGV30;MrMobile;Donovan Hall;i like how mike zoomed in on that fat ass üòè
LGV30;MrMobile;Anonymus;no one can compete with lg when it comes to dual cameras
LGV30;MrMobile;That1Mexican;looks like galaxy phones someone who cant afford iphone or samsung üòÇüòÇ note8
LGV30;MrMobile;RETRO Avis-Johnson;i thought you would have over a million subscribers
LGV30;MrMobile;EnhancedNightmare;no removable battery  its the end of true v line
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Garmon;im still mad about my v10 boot looping
LGV30;MrMobile;shekhar das;u look like tony shark the iron man
LGV30;MrMobile;Soham padsalgikar;how much money
LGV30;MrMobile;Mustafa Hussein;for the price we pay for these devices we should be able to choose whether we want it to run stock android or lgs ui
LGV30;MrMobile;RockSolid;why does every phone manufacturer settle for 3300 mah battery i was split between this one and the s8 active and im probably getting the active because of this
LGV30;MrMobile;Angel 999;its bad phone with headset socket on top of it  which annoy while you use ur phone
LGV30;MrMobile;Tyler Barron;i hope lg get a w and i hope this phone doesn‚Äôt have a major problem done the road and it appear the software experience didn‚Äôt change much but oh well
LGV30;MrMobile;Flaviu;s8 noncurved edition oh my god phone names get so long these daysüíÖ
LGV30;MrMobile;Flaviu;glass on glass ditched the second screen curved the back and the front of course they did by the way that thing on the screen was implemented on the s5 and the iphone before tragic
LGV30;MrMobile;mcjay669;i have a question why are phones with oled screens brighter than lcds but its the opposite on tvs
LGV30;MrMobile;Shayan Ali;f 16 aperture thats amazing
LGV30;MrMobile;shadowstorm545;this phone honestly is so underrated lg needs a better marketing team that apple and samsung has
LGV30;MrMobile;Clearest Blue;amoled is the future
LGV30;MrMobile;Vishvajeet Kumar;does it have portrait mode
LGV30;MrMobile;Abdul Android;oh god this looks like the perfect phone for me right now i know that it will have its flaws like every smartphone does but im sure that those flaws are going to be rather minor things at the moment  im in love
LGV30;MrMobile;Willem Preston;i guess ill hold off on the g6 and wait for the price of this phone to drop to pick it up
LGV30;MrMobile;Raj Singh;front camera still 5 mp poor i think lg dont have enough money to increase front camera size
LGV30;MrMobile;VAHE G.;still not a replacement for my v10
LGV30;MrMobile;Mamo;and to be really useful all it needs now is samsung pay p
LGV30;MrMobile;Prateek Sarna;if only lg could fix their ui

LGV30;MrMobile;Keicam;well done lg
LGV30;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;are you still playing ingress i started because of you all the best
LGV30;MrMobile;ATL;no second screen no removable battery did not mention sd card meh
LGV30;MrMobile;Khawar Naeem;speaker analysis
LGV30;MrMobile;Peter Tollan;please in your final review be clear on the following things  1 sensor size on the cameras this is absolutely critical and yet always gets glossed over in favour of aperture size 2 the field of view relative to a full frame camera is that wide angle lens 18mm 21mm etc this is crucial to anyone interested in photography 3 do proper dynamic range tests dynamic range is for most people the most crucial aspect of how a camera performs even if they dont realise it  i see so many comments getting excited about a f16 aperture but i believe the sensor size on the main camera is only 131 which means the effective aperture is really not that good compared to say the pixel you could really explain this for great brownie points
LGV30;MrMobile;Lee Cason;was gonna get it but then my second g4 bootlooped so nope pre ordered samsung note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Fawad Bilgrami;forgot to mention the removable battery is no more
LGV30;MrMobile;a ra;so what differs the g series and v series kinda same with  samsungs note and galaxy series now

LGV30;MrMobile;Vedant Modak;i think if lg puts the stock software this will be a beast
LGV30;MrMobile;Muhammad Firdaus;the review is goodthis phone is goodwaiting for huawei mate 10 to be revealed
LGV30;MrMobile;younus hadi;every bodys hyped about the iphone 8 and there are phones that are coming that are way better then the iphone 8 would be
LGV30;MrMobile;Rashmit Valvi;seriously man lg v series is the most underrated flagship its just that galaxies and iphones have more publicity
LGV30;MrMobile;Maxim Jonson;i think itd be better if the v series had metal back instead of glass but if theres wireless charging at least it makes sense  and that floating bar should be something like samsungs sidebar or even like the app pie control because this thing here just looks weird
LGV30;MrMobile;Shalin Dave;had to go for an interview but all i could think about was getting back home to watch this video üòÖ
LGV30;MrMobile;ASMR Heaven;well the mate 10 is still to come so another contestor for the tablet throne
LGV30;MrMobile;roshun eppenger;i still wish volume was on the back tired of accidental adjustment when holding several things oh and where do the calls go do they take over your screen or go to that little bar

LGV30;MrMobile;Vadim Katz;it looks just like an s8 and many many other smartphones coming out by the dozen this year all basically using one matrix and applying minute differences the smartphone market is getting very very boring even on the feature side the only exciting new feature to come up in smartphones this year legitimately not gimmicks is sonys 960fps videos everything else is marketing slogans backed up by gimmicks and copied design designisdead
LGV30;MrMobile;Mark Jaggernath;bootloop feature
LGV30;MrMobile;djfoo000;will it bootloop though as android enthusiasts hold their breath in anticipation
LGV30;MrMobile;My Name? Ben Dover;is it only me or i just really noticed that lg is kinda copying samsung in terms of hardware design and software  i mean just look at the home screen looks like samsung touchwiz but lgs style the camera app the icons look at the front side of the phone black slab like s8 but of course the curved corners originated from them but seriously lg
LGV30;MrMobile;Joshua Haeward II;i like the quality of your content and your style of commentary subscribed i guess its also a plus that i find the phone attractive as well

LGV30;MrMobile;Howard Poles;i think im the only one who liked the design of last years v30
LGV30;MrMobile;◊®◊ï◊¢◊ô ◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ì;i like the narrow design of samsung top line up compared to the v30 wide approach   but camera wise i think it its a winner but well have to wait and see pixel 2
LGV30;MrMobile;Vandel Jason Strypper;honestly the thing looks beautiful of this phone is the wallpaper

LGV30;MrMobile;Conor Letham;i thought it was poled not amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;Saurabh Kapoor;why not increase the ram to atleast 6gb and 64gb will be very less for a phone focused on videography i hope there is a 256gb version too
LGV30;MrMobile;Nizar Noor;ohh is this going to be pixel 2 xl display and similar body dimensions perhaps

LGV30;MrMobile;Chandan Lakshman;omg lg did it with this one theyre back in the competition and they gotta do something much better with g7 to rule the smartphone industry
LGV30;MrMobile;Abdrouf;this will be the most under rated phone of 2017

LGV30;MrMobile;Hells favorite angel mike;if you are a camera psycho then this is the perfect phone for you im an audiophile so i have the v20 and i love the hifi dac so even though theres a few things that bum me out like no ir blaster ive never had a phone that was water resistant and every time i get stuck in a rainstorm on my motorcycle i have to take my phone off the handlebars which drives my stereo now i can leave it and keep playing music even in the rain sweet
LGV30;MrMobile;Majd Abokassab;dream phone gonna get after  price drop
LGV30;MrMobile;Giants;apart from the begging for subscriptions i enjoyed this one quite a bit especially your voice is very pleasant to listen to
LGV30;MrMobile;Timothy McSwain;ugh lg is making it really difficult not switching these days and this takes the cake with how much i‚Äôm not looking forward to the ugly design compromises in the next flagship iphone i may just get a lg v30 instead i don‚Äôt want to leave ios but i want the best phone and that sadly isn‚Äôt the iphone anymore that‚Äôs the lg g6 right now without a doubt ‚Äî not including the oneplus 5 because i can‚Äôt get it on my carrier ‚Äî and this could easily take the title in my book

LGV30;MrMobile;Fattah Sameer;does this bootloopü§î
LGV30;MrMobile;Syed Tariq Asghar;no word on audio
LGV30;MrMobile;Blackman Whitesuit;how is lgs software nowadays is it the cleanest nonstock android or is it still midtier
LGV30;MrMobile;Mititelu Radu;just another politically correct video witch in my book means a failed device did they dropped the insulting spec differences based on the region do this device let you enjoy some good music or like many others consider good sound to be optional for a phone any specs about cameras how is the fisheye effect gone  if it is some software we need to see how well it is done in the final product  what is the native iso of the camera for a device where v stands from video one may think that is somehow important all that and more not software related is anybodys guess after watching this video he use to make good videos but this particular one is really bad
LGV30;MrMobile;jad hzim;t cant wait for htc to go crazy baseless screen next year
LGV30;MrMobile;Screaming-Muffin;that th3 v30 will be the best alternative to note 8     true before pixel xl that is

LGV30;MrMobile;Dima Rosca Dall'acqua;this isnt a note 8 rival but is for s8 plus
LGV30;MrMobile;Madbone Gibbs;sounds really nice but will it come with wireless charging in europe
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel  Burgos;honestly i kinda wished i waited for this phone i got the s8 but wow the dual camers are a real eye catcher and the finger print sensor is in a better spot but i wish lg changed their software so it doesnt feel so outdated
LGV30;MrMobile;Nate Harris;first

LGV30;MrMobile;Freaknic;heard urine box
LGV30;MrMobile;LazySpacenoid;this thing should oversold the note8 the only thing lg left behind from samsung is the effectiveness of its marketing effort
LGV30;MrMobile;inglwrosales;it looks great but im sad to see a design that most likely means no more removable battery
LGV30;MrMobile;Tom Burns;why are they still using a 5mp ffc
LGV30;MrMobile;Henri Tero;zooming in and following that phat booty
LGV30;MrMobile;Kevin Trejo;the google pixel 2 which is being manufactured by lg is gonna give the iphone 8 a hell of a run for its money
LGV30;MrMobile;Havoc Effect;what about the dac
LGV30;MrMobile;Sam Douglas;it looks fantastic but i am very hesitant going back to lg after hardware issues with both my lg g4 and nexus 5x i prefer the lg software over samsungs touchwhiz but i think ill wait until its been used in the wild for a bit

LGV30;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;do lg v30s display uses pentilematrix

LGV30;MrMobile;Gov3rningEight;the phone is nice and all but i didnt get the wow factor i was hoping for dont get me wrong i thing this phone will be good but not great i think ill wait to see what the pixel 2 xl brings i currently have the 7plusalready feels out dated i love apple but with the rumored price of 1k with the iphone 8 i cant stay with apple their is no point in getting the 7as will still cost as much as the 7 but with a more premium price and same body style though the rumor of the glass back

LGV30;MrMobile;Afrous Shah;watching this on my op 1
LGV30;MrMobile;goyerman;i loved how the v20s looked even with the camera bump but the rear of the v30 looks ugly to me im glad they finally went oled the v20 was so dull they should of packed 6 gigs of ram because lgs skin even though it seems minimal became so slow over time it was frustrating hopefully lg can continue to innovate there on the right track tho

LGV30;MrMobile;Ahmad Debian;my main 2 concerns to consider it how good is the 3300 mah super disappointing in a large phone same like note 8 why cant they give it a 3500 mah and my other question is what is the expected price tag
LGV30;MrMobile;david G;looks exactly like the g6 is a clone there is no point
LGV30;MrMobile;hyedefinition1080;that phone looks beautiful especially in this video annoyed that they went away with removable batteries but probably a better business decision to make the phone aesthetically pleasing and adding waterproofing meh definitely looks better than the note 8 and possibly s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Shaun Langenberg;damn this phone looks good those videos settings though
LGV30;MrMobile;david G;i cant belive they ditched secondary display and non removable battery is a fail for me honestly

LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen thatll be more expensive the fuck
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;rishit dabhade get note 8 if you can amazing phone if you cant afford it get s9
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen its 750  thats 180 less  it also has almost the exact same specs save for 2gbs less of ram and a pen  the v30 has the quaddac hd haptics and a wider screen  pretty sure theyre about equal
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;faterfoid 69 it will but only 100 less but its also worse than the note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;ezequiel s8 won it
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;joseph harvey ikr and the floating bar is samsung edge apps
LGV30;MrMobile;Nawrez Elbitar;jesus sanchez yes it has watch other reviews
LGV30;MrMobile;Jesus Sanchez;mahdin chechen thank you
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;jesus sanchez i dont think so
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;jahangir miah dont upgrade wait till s9 or when a beast phone comes out that beats s8 this is just a s8 clone
LGV30;MrMobile;osoifamf;john merced not true the v20 has had cases of bootloop too
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;john merced hahahaha dont worry mate s9 is gonna trash every phone in a few months
LGV30;MrMobile;Shis Chougule;what would you suggest for a different phonemy plans for a phone is during this christmas
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;shis chougule go for note 8 if you can if not than go for a different phone
LGV30;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;mahdin chechen exactly and personally im loving the v30 more than the note8
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;emad ahmed yeah they did a good job usually lg never comes close to samsung but this year they managed to get close to samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;mahdin chechen yeah i agree they copied samsung but thats what makes it great because samsung design was amazing and now it feels like a perfect samsung alternative
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;emad ahmed true but they copied samsung even with samsung edge apps with the floating bar but hey everyone has theyre  opinion
LGV30;MrMobile;Sam Forster;what are you smoking theres a headphone jack and it has the largest aperture in a phone at f16 so what are you talking about no low light camera
LGV30;MrMobile;Sam Forster;damian z decently nothing special about on par with samsung i would say
LGV30;MrMobile;Lucas Munhoz;dontbeweakvato i perder lg v30 poled os resistent display all tests are hardcore to lg v30 win
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen bc it is  value makes a phone great as well  no dumbass would pay 4000 for the most high specs in a phone  it may have the best specs but its not the best phone dumbass
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;ryan t it added the f16 aperture which is the first in any phone a glass phone lens also first an oled display which the g series has never had and a quad dac which is available in all versions of the v30 and is much improved from the v20  it also has some really great haptic feedback similar to the iphones taptic engine  it has all of those crazy cine video features too  plus its bigger
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;ryan t lmao and everyone says its the best phone of 2017
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;andres perez ikr everyone just overhyped it and says its the best phone of 2017 not even true and when s9 comes out in like 7 months its gonna destroy every phone but this year the best phone will probably be iphone 8 but its not out so we cant say that yet
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;billionaire barbaros lmao they copied samsung and samsung is still on top but lg got closer than befor thats all
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;thehotstuff v30s8op5
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;thehotstuff lmao not even true its s8v30op5
LGV30;MrMobile;Shellyman Vol.2;lmao the v30 is miles better than the iphone 7 plus clone oneplus 5
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;nuwl yes and its more controllable
LGV30;MrMobile;King Of Kings;lucas rodrigues „ÉÑ maybe they will call it v35
LGV30;MrMobile;Michael Janicki;and v50 and v70 and now also v90 haha
LGV30;MrMobile;Big BLOCK life;fackin swedes everywhere
LGV30;MrMobile;LucaS RodrigueS „ÉÑ;royalbengal101 xd
LGV30;MrMobile;royalbengal101;snoop high asf all good me to fam
LGV30;MrMobile;LucaS RodrigueS „ÉÑ;schakaljr i didnt know my comment was on top üòÇüòÇüòÇ
LGV30;MrMobile;schakaljr;im not sure why your comment isnt on top d
LGV30;MrMobile;Andio-GAMER 201561;bticronox camera is revolutionary f16 aperture wider than othersright now
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;i can already smell the sheeple post bullshit like revolutionary bezelless screen made by lg xd d
LGV30;MrMobile;TechPimp;mrmobile michael fisher still a great video
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];wasnt briefed on the plus version didnt know it existed until this video was already in the can
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;uhm this is 14 times mil std 810g proof and therefore more stable than the v20
LGV30;MrMobile;MICOLE WHYTE;aman talreja also who wants to carry a thick power bank around in your pocket you still got to use a wire to connect your phone to the power bank thats a lot more of a hassle than just putting to thin spare batteries in your side pocket
LGV30;MrMobile;MICOLE WHYTE;aman talreja waterproofing is overrated removable batteries is better  i have an lg v20 i live in washington dc area yes it rains a lot i never had any problems with my v20 getting wet i got a bunch of different cases for my lg v20 and i have a tempered glass screen protector on the front of my lg v20 also ive seen videos of people dumping the lg v20 into water in the v20 can take a splash is not ips 68 but is ip 67 it can take a splash you people really underestimate the power of removable batteries i have 4 lg v20 batteries plus a 8 portable battery charger that i got from amazon and you know what i dont even use my usb type c charger that comes with the phone you know why  because i dont have to while everybody else at my job with their samsung note 5  or s7 and iphones are looking for chargers because their phone about to die i can easily just go into my backpack get one of my three spare batteries out and go from 0 to 100 in less than a minute and then take my battery that was dead and pop it in my 8 battery charger and plug that into socket when i go out all day battery life is the least of my concerns i leave out the house with two spare batteries in my pocket leave my 4th spare battery home and im good to go just like when i went to go see wonder woman and alien covenant back to back in june both of those movies that i saw were over 2 hours long and i was out all day  then i went out to eat and was just relaxing downtown washington dc i didnt get in the house till like 3am in the morning one battery died i took it out pop my second spare battery in got home that battery was like at 40 didnt even have to use my third spare battery that was in my pocket waterproofing is overrated
LGV30;MrMobile;Aman Talreja;ben valenzuela water resistent is fuckin way better than batteries  go buy a power bank
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;samsung never built poled panels neither is the galaxy multiple mil std 810 certified as much as the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;Mr Valenzuela;ddd bbb but samsung has been doing that for a while now
LGV30;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;ben valenzuela oled screen and water resistance is more than enough to purchase it
LGV30;MrMobile;Dirty Asian Mafia;kevin jaramillo dat pun
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;robizzlor ye but people say its the best phone of 2017 lmao i mean its came close to samsung which they never got to do but lg did it so yeah not even the best phone of 2017 probably up there but not the best btw im not samsung fanboy although i like samsung a lot
LGV30;MrMobile;Rares Petrescu;j dod yes it will come to europe
LGV30;MrMobile;Mow Better Lawn Service;cd riley have you used a moto x pure edition lg v20
LGV30;MrMobile;C.D. Riley;mow better lawn service 3300mah small
LGV30;MrMobile;Live Strong;pointless guy lies
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;live strong selfies are the cancer of society
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;lester dimaoala ikr just copied samsung and with the design of the display aswell
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen the floating bar is the old second screen you dumbass
LGV30;MrMobile;Crazcompart;mahdin chechen  ive used both ss and apple in the past to be fair iphone configured game apps run better as does safari otherwise im  really not impressed
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;crazcompart you are a retard iphone 8 is gonna outclass this shitty phone lmao floating bar is just edge apps from samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;john doe it started as glass and then went to plastic with a non removable battery
LGV30;MrMobile;Peter Ford;nyan spider it is a nice phone though but im still begging for nice front facing stereo speakers to no avail it seems
LGV30;MrMobile;Peter Ford;nyan spider thats ok wireless charging isnt a prerequisite for me anyway doesnt have to be carbon fiber just anything other than glass im sure there are materials that would accommodate wireless charging  and not be a crackable slippery surface
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;peter ford i dont think wireless charging works with carbon fiber
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;and a dac that would be worth 300 alone
LGV30;MrMobile;Sadique Khan;rahul vs yup it is pmoled poled is different it is called when plastic is used instead of glass as a substrate which reduce the thickness like in the case of lg g flex all cuve edge display is made using plastic substrate so samsung edge display are amoled poled display because matrix is amoled and substrate is plastic
LGV30;MrMobile;Rahul VS;sadique khan hmm pmoled would have been a better name then just saying
LGV30;MrMobile;Sadique Khan;p is for passive matrix not for plastic
LGV30;MrMobile;Andres Hernandez;pranish khadgi samsung also uses plastic substrates in their displays thats how they achieve those curved edges and they both use an active matrix so they really are both the same basic technology just advertise it differently this article explains it pretty well httpwwwandroidauthoritycompoledvsamoled792869
LGV30;MrMobile;Pranish Khadgi;waleed el mhamal well im not saying that poled is not made out up of plastic it is but there is no big difference in poled and amoled poled is also basically amoled because it also uses active matrix technology and amoled displays can be made from plastic too its just manufacturers who choose what glass is rigid while plastic is more flexible and cost efficient  its just the matter of how brand advertises it samsung decided to advertise saying amoled and lg decided to advertise saying poled but the reality is they both are oled and they both uses active matrix non of them uses passive matrix technology so you can say both are active matrix oled or amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;Waleed EL Mhamal;pranish khadgi theres a difference poled is just made with plastic thats why its called poled
LGV30;MrMobile;David Vanity;its just oled from there tvs not poled  if you check out there website or promotion videos will speak for its self
LGV30;MrMobile;Pranish Khadgi;levi dauerheim nope its poled samsung advertises as amoled lg advertises as poled no physical difference tho
LGV30;MrMobile;levi Dauerheim;pranish khadgi it is a amoled display
LGV30;MrMobile;Andres Hernandez;pranish khadgi yes it is amoled it uses an active matrix and samsung also uses plastic in there displays it just comes down to how they are advertised but both samsung and lg are amoled and they are also both poled it is just how they advertise it
LGV30;MrMobile;Waleed EL Mhamal;explore with rick its same but poled is oled but made from plastic
LGV30;MrMobile;Explore with Rick;pranish khadgi whats the difference
LGV30;MrMobile;OUTSID3R;thechronic4twenty fair enough mate but remember there are kids here as well they have no sense of humour
LGV30;MrMobile;thechronic4twenty;never said that was funny i made the username ten years ago  grown men smoke weed too just ask carl sagan way off topic though but thanks for your comment on topic ive followed pocketnow since the beginning and this guy obviously knows a lot but cant stand these funny stuff in the videos if he could please stop then i could actually subscribe
LGV30;MrMobile;OUTSID3R;you‚Äôre not a grown man if you think 420 is funny
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen dumbass that was there since the v10 which has the second screen
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;ate dont worry mate s8 is still better they copied edge apps and with the display
LGV30;MrMobile;OUTSID3R;the bigger the screen the more power that needs to be output
LGV30;MrMobile;Rashmit Valvi;johnmade69 yes i know about the bootloops but even galaxy s4 and s5 faced bootloops it was not a manufacturing defect though it was due to heating problem which is a totally different cause every phone has some defects but that doesnt mean you stop buying that brand
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;rashmit valvi the problem is that the lg v series suffers from constant bootloops had it on lg v10 and v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Tyrone Long;mahdin chechen get off samsung nuts coming from a galaxy s8 user
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen samsung out here copying apple  it took the telephoto lens 3d touch only where home button used to be portrait mode etc
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;vadim katz omg bro so true most of the phones just copy samsung design lmao even iphone
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;djfoo000 yes my lg g6 v20 v1p had bootloopsim done with lg
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;imran chowdhury 750
LGV30;MrMobile;Dirty Asian Mafia;marcel klein same
LGV30;MrMobile;Vincent Scauzzo;marcel klein yeah rip us
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;saqib ejaz the lg g6 did
LGV30;MrMobile;Harpreet06;the software didnt cause bootloops from what i heard and who knows if its still present on the v30 other than that id say lg software is less laggy than touchwiz
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;harpreet06 the s8 is at a low price and has a better software that doesnt have bootloops
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;iga not with bootloops
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;pibz314 youre going to regret it until you experience bootloops and worst lag than a midrange android device
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;ibrahim ishaq enjoy the bootloops
LGV30;MrMobile;hey there;king leo xvii yes
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];sawbonz around back its the circular button on the spine
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;sma das the volume button is on the side the power button is on the back
LGV30;MrMobile;Dirty Asian Mafia;sma das ur dumb
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen dumbass what the hell  as i told you its the v10s second screen  it doesnt completely obstruct the screen like the retarded edge display
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;kenneth raiford lmao thanks bro everyone saying the best android phone of 2017 or some shit the floating bar is edge apps from samsung and the design is copied from samsung aswell
LGV30;MrMobile;Luke et;that being said i still want this phone
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];he will
LGV30;MrMobile;Mike Kreiberg;mrmobile michael fisher nice d
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];its there wasnt allowed to discuss its performance per the terms of the embargo governing release of this video ill touch on it in the full review though
LGV30;MrMobile;Joseph Acosta;custnam sure you got lots of money there
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];yeah  its weird but thats what theyre saying gorilla glass 5 front and back milstd 810g tested of course milstd 810g doesnt actually mean much of anything since companies can sort of arbitrarily decide how they want to test their own products  but id say its a safe bet that the v30 will take impacts better than the apparently fragile s8 well see
LGV30;MrMobile;sai umesh;velizar milutinovic i agree but remember when g6 was released it as costly as s8 and but now its as costly as oneplus5 in very less time
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;velizar milutinovic dude lg price is dropping very fast faster than samsung in my country u can get v20 less than s7e with added bonus like battery pack and u can get g6 with the price of one plus 5 damn
LGV30;MrMobile;Marauder Shields;velizar milutinovic but lg phones decrease in price way faster than any of the other big brands
LGV30;MrMobile;Velizar Milutinovic;sai umesh every phone decreases its price after a while
LGV30;MrMobile;Apti Newim;no
LGV30;MrMobile;You Know Who;apti newim fuck u
LGV30;MrMobile;Apti Newim;why would you watch other channels i watch only mrmobile mkbhd linus
LGV30;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;mrmobile michael fisher you deserve it sir  you are amazing
LGV30;MrMobile;Roshin Nishad;mrmobile michael fisher youre just too good
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];appreciate the support
LGV30;MrMobile;shahirahmed007;mrmobile michael fisher thats good probably my next phone now enjoy germany
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no theyve upgraded it to gorilla glass 4 on the camera lens cover
LGV30;MrMobile;ffs stop blazing;thecambra i still prefer the touchwiz home
LGV30;MrMobile;TheCambra;ffs stop blazing what s the difference i own both of and the s8 lol icons are the same what am i missing ü§ó
LGV30;MrMobile;ffs stop blazing;kerron walker true story the s8 launcher is just so beautiful
LGV30;MrMobile;Tyrone Long;kerron walker nova launcher
LGV30;MrMobile;osoifamf;thecambra noooooo
LGV30;MrMobile;TheCambra;kerron walker the software skin the software skin looks identical to the galaxy s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Kerron Walker;ffs stop blazing as a samsung owner this phone is beautiful but that fucking software skin is fucking ugly honestly
LGV30;MrMobile;Paul Caldwell;videoscord those oneplus phones were never flagship killers unattractive glorified toys with awful cameras that had absolutely no place being compared to real highend devices
LGV30;MrMobile;Mihai Lazar;i would not reccommend flashing a custom rom on a phone with 189 though just saying
LGV30;MrMobile;applekumi;after oneplus 3t oneplus lost its merit
LGV30;MrMobile;voidz;while the oneplus 5s software is much better its very easy to customize the v30 to make it look just how you want with themes launchers and even flashing a rom
LGV30;MrMobile;Angel last name;videoscord yeah but it will be at the same price as the s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Videoscord;angel last name im saying in the sense that it will be priced much less than note 8 this is my point
LGV30;MrMobile;Videoscord;betternet youre right i understand many people will say oneplus better ui overall near stock android look and feel but if you see overall lg v30 has good hi res audio dac and very good camera with ip68 certification and hopefully lg will give better experience with software this time
LGV30;MrMobile;Videoscord;laurensius satya yes thats my point
LGV30;MrMobile;Videoscord;savagearfad i hard that itll be priced around 700  and also i hard that itll be priced lesser than note 8 so i think itll be better deal overall
LGV30;MrMobile;SavageArfad;has a nice camera but wait for the price there‚Äôs also the fingerprint sensor placement the poor enough bottom facing speaker and it doesn‚Äôt come with oreo which it should the quad dac wasn‚Äôt that impressive on the v6 feels light in the hand from reports
LGV30;MrMobile;Angel last name;videoscord but this phone is going to cost around Ôπ©800 so how is that a flagship killer
LGV30;MrMobile;JakeTheFakeReal;the v30 isnt a flagship killer its a flagship and a promising one at that
LGV30;MrMobile;Betternet;lawrence wong probably but it brought nothing really exciting to the table
LGV30;MrMobile;Lawrence Wong;betternet true but its probably cheaper than the v30
LGV30;MrMobile;Betternet;videoscord one plus 5 was a flop they got greedy
LGV30;MrMobile;Kyra;oneplus still has lg beat on software oneplus offers a more appealing ux and may cause someone who values timely software updates and smoother operations to pick the oneplus over the g6 or v30
LGV30;MrMobile;JRav;it hasnt been for a long time
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Smith;laurensius satya hmm good point ill delete my comment
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;daniel smith maybe he want to say one plus is used to be flagship killer they cheap and powerful now oneplus 5 is mor expensive and even with that money you can get v20 or g6 r8 nowin some countries i mean there is no ip certification nothing new to add to the phone it is just like another expensive phone with 835 i mean if u buy v20 u get better audio camera in still and video audio recorder dual display drop resistance and 820 is still serviceable and if u add just a lil bit extra money you can get s8  which is way better than 1why bother except u in a country where 1is way cheaper but most of people in the comment section saying that 1 is equal to g6 and v20 price cmiiw
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];one who knows the difference between a quick handson video and a full review also the video starts with a selfie sample cool snark tho appreciate it
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];thanks
LGV30;MrMobile;Adrian Ambriz;man bear pig lol it convinced me after the 8th video
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;lou bernabeu poled is a type of amoled
LGV30;MrMobile;C.C. Fung;mrmobile michael fisher i thought the same that it is mistook as the note8üòÇ
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];i believe that particular shot is an overtheshoulder look at andrew martonik trying to summon the app drawer samsungstyle maybe
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];no
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];at least four colors total but regiondependent probably some carrier exclusives in there too because ugh
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];1 youre not using politically correct properly 2 yes they dropped the major spec differences across regions wireless charging as i mentioned in the vo and quad dac is in every market as well 3 any specs about cameras yeah tons theyre in the spec card at 111 4 its not gone its reduced how so use your eyes samples at 203 217 and 223 5 im not allowed to get into the specifics of certain features per the terms of the review embargo because this is a handson and not a review maybe youre confused 6 might wanna check yourself or at least watch the whole video before your next baseless rant
LGV30;MrMobile;SAW9;no the note8 will blow this outta the water
LGV30;MrMobile;Putu Gunarko;mrmobile michael fisher thanks god still got 35 jack audio in 2017 cz its so essential oops haha
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];yep its got a 35mm port up top quad dac too if you care about that
LGV30;MrMobile;Denracer;mrmobile michael fisher thank you thank you d love your video since pocket now keep it up michael
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];sick burn
LGV30;MrMobile;SAW9;only took em 3 years  to copy samsungs edge features
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen nigga as i said before its 750
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;dirty asian mafia lmao note 8 costs 1000 and this will cost 900 and the plus version even more
LGV30;MrMobile;Dirty Asian Mafia;panos ad but it costs more
LGV30;MrMobile;Aman Talreja;dima dallacqua less cost  better camerafor sure cause samsung is using the 2016 s7 edge camera lens in note 8  hi fi audio  cine video  better microphones for concertstudio recordings forsure  better performance and yeah better alwayson display feature also v30 is pretty lightweight  just 153 grams  same as my honor 8
LGV30;MrMobile;hamode mu;dima dallacqua a prowide angel lens maybe which samsung and apple are lazy to add to their phones üòè
LGV30;MrMobile;Mist Passiert;better camera how its got a wide angle instead of an optical zoom lens different uses the software on the v30 will likely outshine the note 8 as its more professional but my biggest question is this does the wide angle lens have ois if not note 8 comes out on top  the quad dac is nice but with high quality head phones i doubt ill notice a difference between the note 8 and my v20 assuming same quad dac technology the price is expected to be 800 which is only 130 less than the note 8 which has 2gb additional ram better version of android ive always preferred samsungs additional features on top of stock android and better software support my v20 is still on android 70 not even 710 after almost a year the note 8 also has the spen which having been a note 3 user who upgraded to the note 7 and had it taken away i sorely miss the spen its uses are quite extensive you also get a larger higher quality display on the note 8 vs the v30 at the end of the day im going back to samsung  all of this not considering my horrendous experience with my v20 ive done 3 warranty exchanges
LGV30;MrMobile;Dima Rosca Dall'acqua;what this phone offer more than a note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Ricardo117;i think this phone has a better package overall and of course better camera and audio with a probably much cheaper price so yeah the note 8 is no rival for the v30 hehe
LGV30;MrMobile;Dude Lmao;note 8 is in a league of its own considering the price and specs no other phone today can catch up to it price is the only flaw with it that and the fact that its only a monospeaker
LGV30;MrMobile;Shellyman Vol.2;lol the note 8 pretty much has the same specs as the s8 plus so this is a note 8 rival
LGV30;MrMobile;Madbone Gibbs;mrmobile michael fisher nice üëç
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];yes wireless charging in all regions
LGV30;MrMobile;SAW9;that 3300mah battery might not help it as well
LGV30;MrMobile;LazySpacenoid;mahdin chechen and your point is
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mahdin chechen its 750 where the hell you get 900 from  europe is different
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;lazyspacenoid mate its gonna cost 899 usd
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];yep this is a fair point would have enjoyed seeing a really kickass ffc with ois
LGV30;MrMobile;thatchinaboi;im not trying to bash the v20  its my favorite phone ive ever had and i dont plan on upgrading it for a few years due to the removable battery  i am just telling you my personal experience  it doesnt seem like the bootloop issue is as widespread on the v20 as with the other previous lg phones  but that is not to say it hasnt happened to the unfortunate minority
LGV30;MrMobile;thatchinaboi;and for the record the bootloop happened a week after i bought the v20  i wasnt doing anything crazy with it  it just randomly bootlooped for no apparent reason
LGV30;MrMobile;thatchinaboi;key word is had i obviously got it fixed somehow if i am using it right now
LGV30;MrMobile;Eric Ojeda;thatchinaboi if that were the case then you wouldnt even be able to use it
LGV30;MrMobile;ReGGie siZzla‚Ñ¢;ooh here we go im tired of hearing this stupid bootloop issue that was the g4 days not present with g5g6v20
LGV30;MrMobile;thatchinaboi;thisath ranawaka the v20 i am typing on had a bootloop issue
LGV30;MrMobile;Thisath Ranawaka;sam douglas bootloop hasnt been issue since the v10 dont worry
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;sorry the frontfacing camera is the worst thing on this phone but its pros outweigh the flaws and im getting it
LGV30;MrMobile;Spencerwalker21;luigi l at least its wide angle
LGV30;MrMobile;McRocket;spencerwalker21  uhhhyeah  i dont chat with youtube trolls i will to my knowledge not read any more of your replies
LGV30;MrMobile;Spencerwalker21;mcrocket lol triggered factsyour feels
LGV30;MrMobile;McRocket;spencerwalker21  the v20 was not revolutionary it was somewhat evolutionary at best 5 or 6 years ago phones were massively changing all the time companies trying new rather exotic things all the time then from 4 years ago until last year  phones innovated by growing then they hit the 56 wall and stopped as that is about as big as you can get now they are little more than pretty bricks with very little to distinguish one from another smartphone innovation is in a massive rut right now
LGV30;MrMobile;Spencerwalker21;mcrocket they did the v20 and it didnt sell so cant blame them for making what sells
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;saw9 dumbass zoom uses the normal camera the wide angle goes back
LGV30;MrMobile;SAW9;hope its not a day you need optical image stabilization to use that cool point to zoom feature  lol
LGV30;MrMobile;Spencerwalker21;gadget buzz das v30 plus will have 6gb

LGV30;MrMobile;LegendarySkypenis;lee ka shing  its an upgrade but a real life significant one to trade a semi new phone no one upgrades there gaming laptops for a to get to an app a couple seconds faster or better web cam regardless the v30 looks amazing
LGV30;MrMobile;Lee Ka Shing;legendaryskypenis not an upgrade for you doesnt mean other people can utilise the phone‚Äôs features
LGV30;MrMobile;LegendarySkypenis;laurensius satya i only use my phone for pornhub and texting  none of that lost doesnt even seem appealing to me and if your gonna trade your phone for something rugged and upgrade anyway the following year then whats the point lol dont even care about wireless charging  plugging it takes like 1 more second out of my life i think ill be fine but again if you got the money and it makes u happy go for it

LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;amiya jalui portrait mode is pretty easy to do the effect only requires some depth sense
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;my beautiful and amazing mistress thats why iphones are not that durable and not reliable enough
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;abe i have it bough v20 4 months ago tbh v20 back is the best for me glass phone is slippery hate my samsung s6e s7e s8 but well i love v20 sadly i have to put a case because that camera bumb is insane if only the make it like g4 or g6 with less bump so i can feel the metal
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;abe yup its only on the v30 though not on the g6
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;remixedvoice dont worry the craftsmanship of v30 is milstd810g drop and shock resistant solar radiation resistant and salt resistant so it is as durable as the v20 it also has faster quick charge through usb c with the snapdragon 835
LGV30;MrMobile;RemixedVoice;abe yes the v20s back is made from aircraft grade aluminum i also have no need for wireless charging either i dont mind taking an extra second to plug my phone in and get faster charging speeds also i often like to use and hold my phone when its charging and you cant do that with wireless charging if im going to leave it on my desk ill just plug it in
LGV30;MrMobile;Abe;laurensius satya its a metal back but is removable do to a release button on the device
LGV30;MrMobile;Abe;pointless guy lg uses technologysoftware thats better than samsungs fast wireless charging thats neat
LGV30;MrMobile;Abe;youre saying the g6 back doesnt feel premium its the first phone ive used the ive looked at and was like yeah i should be holding this ive held a s7 nexus 6p etc and everytime i was like nah
LGV30;MrMobile;Carlos Pao;omar ben sassi ugh
LGV30;MrMobile;BackTrakt;omar ben sassi they do make battery packs that use wireless charging as an option to charge your phone
LGV30;MrMobile;Omar Ben Sassi;chris li they call it wireless charging but for me its notyou need a cable to put in the pad so how they call this wireless you can unplug cable from the pad and put it directly to the phone for more speedi will call this wireless when they do wireless pad
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;mista macho on some level i agree why tf they need to use glass on back ip rating and wireless charging take more then they give
LGV30;MrMobile;Chris Li;pointless guy what about samsung fast wireless charging
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;john doe the sim card slot can also be used to fit 2 sims and an sd card slot look at xiaomi with the redmi note 5a
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;laurensius satya qipma wireless charging plus lg v30 has fast wireless charging compared to its competitors
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;john doe why not oem made back plastic with metal on the side i mean like v20 it may works metallic phone with high quality plastic on the bqvk it didnt block signal it is more durable and you can get removable battery
LGV30;MrMobile;John Doe;pointless guy plastic gives the option for removable battery and micro sd card slot or extra sim card slot also it may scratch easier but it is more durable than glass not to mention probably at least half of smartphone owners use a case or skin
LGV30;MrMobile;Mista Macho;pointless guy glass is fine but at least give it some texture like the moto z 2016  it would so nice with that frosted finish  they could also switch the iphone 5 style with metal on top and mostly glass
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;tams80 high quality plastic can be scratched with keys and screwdrivers while glass doesnt
LGV30;MrMobile;Tams80;you can however do it with a plastic back  you can also get high quality plastic
LGV30;MrMobile;abhijit gojara;randomlegos except that camera portion  everything is looks like s8
LGV30;MrMobile;RandomLegos;abhijit gojara you mean g6 inspired design  its litterally a g6 with front curved glass and a small camera bump  i like the g6 design better but the v30 still looks rugged nonetheless
LGV30;MrMobile;Ify Nsoha;aaron wafflez seriously lg has made an amazing comeback the v30 is the best phone out right now
LGV30;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;g6
LGV30;MrMobile;larry_the_villan;mrmobile michael fisher ok good i look forward to your in depth review
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];larrythevillan yes and yes plus a bunch of new presets havent tested that stuff yet
LGV30;MrMobile;TheJoeMB;mmh my g4 died after a year  a half give it time in all honesty that experience put me off lg
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];thejoemb hasnt happened to my g6 once so
LGV30;MrMobile;Swapnil Dutta;mrmobile michael fisher but still looks like a better phone than the note 8 other than the front camand thanks for the reply üòâüòâ
LGV30;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];swapnil dutta this is a good point especially considering how hard theyre pushing the generation video angle
LGV30;MrMobile;mounir Tetouani;valdemir villanueva yeah right lol
LGV30;MrMobile;ReGGie siZzla‚Ñ¢;what are you smoking no need for an ois on wide sensor its a waste
LGV30;MrMobile;Lim Chee Hean;wide angle doesnt need ois
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin Beast;zuhair nazarudin loses out to what exactly there is no other company that even does the ultra wide angle setup so you cant be second when youre all alone
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;en force i hate people who demand facts and offer not a source to their claim
LGV30;MrMobile;DJ Johns V3;it is a plastic oled display like the display on my moto z2 force edition it is a technology that we have had since 2015 with the motorola droid turbo two which was touted as the first and only at the time shatterproof display and that technology was moved over to the last year model of the moto z force edition that is also how lg allows the phone to be milspec 810g
LGV30;MrMobile;lebrahjames;please learn what amoled is an acronym to then tell me i was wrong these screens use the same fundamental design of having an active matrix tft substrate which gives them the name amoled amoled is not a brand name you can look at the us trademark database the only trademark samsung owns regarding amoled is super amoled and an amoled logo with an rgb colored band
LGV30;MrMobile;Anthony J;money  singh it is as good compare it next to the s8
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;lebrahjames uhm why does he have to i already did
LGV30;MrMobile;lebrahjames;the burden of proof is on you
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;lebrahjames sure im one being that since you are one claiming wrong facts
LGV30;MrMobile;lebrahjames;please cite your claims and stop being retarded
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;lebrahjames my god are you playing stupid or you really are stupid  first of all oled have much deeper blacks and much whiter whites they are similiar in some way but oled or poled is way better then amoledbut lets say that lg v30 uses amoledit does not why would they take their competitors display technology from samsung rathen then puting their oled panels that are also used on lg uhd oled tvs so they would instantly kill their game and had a lot of problems so basicly they would be in hand of samsung to do whatever samsung wants in one world they would be invulnerable
LGV30;MrMobile;lebrahjames;amoled is not a brand name and is accurate nomenclature for the display found on the v30 it only refers to the active matrix tft substrate found in the display as opposed to a passive screen
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;abhilash krishnamurthy here httpwwwoledatwpcontentuploads201406samsungdisplayvslgoledtvtechnicaljpg lgs tvs all have a woled panel since 2014 since then refined and refined lg also wouldnt take amoled panels from samsung and even if they did samsung wouldnt allow them so they have to build their own  and their oled printing machines just produce woled so its highly probable that they have the woled built in the v30 just with a plastic instead of glass shield
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;money singh techno buffalo disagrees with you httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoo8acsmomui
LGV30;MrMobile;Abhilash Krishnamurthy;bticronox source
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;abhilash krishnamurthy wrong amoled uses subpixels directly lighting in their respective colour red blue green in a diagonal pentile matrix with only 2 subpixels green red and then green blue while lg oled only uses white subpixels whose light shines through an wrgb filter
LGV30;MrMobile;Christian Christian;what are the differences
LGV30;MrMobile;SapSave;ya its lgs own poled display
LGV30;MrMobile;RDN NDR;their oled is still technically active matrix oled same tech different medium lg uses plastic amoled is just samsung marketing name
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;patrick yea and i hope that oled dont have screen burn in like amoled can occur
LGV30;MrMobile;Patrick;en force oled is one of the best display technologies why do you think tvs and upcoming monitors are using it
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;next tech thanks for saying it i did go from 0100 really quick when he said amoled when is oled or poled

LGV30;MrMobile;osoifamf;cool person true
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;kingslayer i personally like music that doesnt sound like shit so i stay away from the pixel devices they are awful take your headphones and do a comparison at a store with a v20 or htc 10 lol if you can find one and ill be damned if the pixel doesnt start looking uglier as you hold it the moment you hear the difference in sound
LGV30;MrMobile;cool person;shahan aj as a samsung phone this phone almost defeats the note 8 but i think due to the s pen and largee screen and amount of features that i could see my self using i would never prefer the note 8 to this but i would prefer this over the s8
LGV30;MrMobile;MrRonski;n3xo samsung puts good features to phone but there are also useless features that are cool but you almost never use them ui is not so laggy but its still notably slower than oxygen os or stock android
LGV30;MrMobile;MrRonski;samsung puts too many features to their phones the ui is laggy also its not easy to take spotlight from samsung but its easier to make better phones than samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Will C;this is me thats because the edge series look sexy
LGV30;MrMobile;This is Me;shahan aj samsung is so damn over rated
LGV30;MrMobile;SlenderMarc;zorkor if a phone company gets the best features to improve their phones that doesnt mean theyre copying

LGV30;MrMobile;Kingslayer;deathstroke 87 dont forget image retentionghosting both my g5 and v20 show it glad they now switched to oled v30 is also smaller nearly same size as g6 but rounder and more refined nicest design by lg in awhile the biggest concern is that software skin and the flaws that start showing up later many users do not see it now wait a few months  might as well stick to pixel no hardware issues and i dont trust htc all that much but after nearly six months no weird hardware issues and no software skin to make it feel laggy and bloated stock android is the way to go to make it age better will miss wideangle though
LGV30;MrMobile;Scott M;socksnbiscuits  i would say apple or htc for customer service  im on htc u11 now because they were really good with me years ago with my m7 apple seems good also the few times i dealt with them and they have so many locations
LGV30;MrMobile;Deathstroke 87;shahan aj maybe if lg phones wouldnt constantly bootloop then people would trust them enough to buy their phones
LGV30;MrMobile;Charlie Nico;shahan aj as i went to this comment he said that line fuck
LGV30;MrMobile;mahdin chechen;ignacio verdugo bro this shitty phone is just a ripoff s8 floating bar is edge apps and the design is also copied from s8 note 8 is better and even s8
LGV30;MrMobile;RORY REVOLUTION;johnny pigman the pixel runs stock android and sony phones run a very light custom ui over their phones i already said i was talking about heavy custom uis like touchwiz and lgs ui
LGV30;MrMobile;Sean Dougherty;while this looks like a pretty solid device the note 8 is going to demolish it in sales lmao
LGV30;MrMobile;Prashanth Murali;ignacio verdugo yeah right i cant remember the last time lg even remotely challenged samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Jay Maqsood;this will likely be cheaper so if thats a priority then this is it note8 in my view is so much better looking thats not important to everyone i understand i personally dont like how v30 looks it looks so outdated like an iphone with thinner bezel i really do want these videorecording related features and upgrades though very conflicted at the moment im dumping my iphone and cant decide if i should wait for this or just bite the bullet and keep my note8 preorder
LGV30;MrMobile;Deathstroke 87;ignacio verdugo lmfao you wont be saying that once this phone bootloops like other lg phones
LGV30;MrMobile;Reda Heinze;lol
LGV30;MrMobile;Affan Khan;i am actually getting note 8 after watching this video i was debating on whether to get v30 or note 8 but i have came to a conclusion that its going to be a note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Ignacio Verdugo;johnmade69 you can borrow my time machine and go back 2 years ago if you really want that joke to work
LGV30;MrMobile;johnmade69;ignacio verdugo you can borrow the s pen when your lg phone dies of bootloops
LGV30;MrMobile;Shadow Gamer;johnny pigman i mean sony is on the near stock android spectrum if it comes to its skins
LGV30;MrMobile;brown bobby;nonote 8 should be fine it has large fandom but samsung lg apple pixel all with amoledones with no amoled will be considered fake premiumrip huawei
LGV30;MrMobile;Johnny Pigman;rory revolution it doesnt have to be an ios software for those factors to be considered  if google pixel runs smoothly on a sd821 with just 4gb ram i dont see any reason why everybody else in the android world cant do the same thing   even sony has proven how you can make a custom skinned android perform buttery smooth like an iphone
LGV30;MrMobile;RORY REVOLUTION;alexandru ciorda≈ü we are taking about android phones here not iphones ios is more optimized and far less demanding vs a heavy ui skinned android phone nice try though
LGV30;MrMobile;Alexandru Ciorda≈ü;rory revolution well iphone 7 says otherwise more ram than 23 gb is strictly for multitasking if you want better a performance you need better cpu and gpu and as for slowing down over time learn  how ssd works
LGV30;MrMobile;RORY REVOLUTION;alexandru ciorda≈ü you dont know what i do or dont know and you havent even added anything to your argument you cant deny that more is better its not even a cost issue as far cheaper phones have 6gb of ram if you are fine with just having 4 fine im disappointed by it because as i said thats last years specs if not even back in late 2015
LGV30;MrMobile;Alexandru Ciorda≈ü;rory revolution you still have no idea how ram works though
LGV30;MrMobile;Amal Crispin;mona swanson remember when lg g3 outsells samsung definitly lg v30 is the best phone of 2017
LGV30;MrMobile;RORY REVOLUTION;alexandru ciorda≈ü not true and even so thats a piss ass justification  you dont buy a new flagship android phone with a flagship price attached and say you know im glad they didnt upgrade the specs last years are just fine the one plus series has had 6gb of ram for nearly 2 years now and it is very welcomed i complained about the s8 not having 6gb of ram and thankfully they corrected that with the note 8  eventually all phones like computers slow down a faster processor will help but if it doesnt have the ram to keep up itll slow down even faster and worse
LGV30;MrMobile;Mona Swanson;you can make jokes all you want but note8 will fuck this phone in sales

LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;yeet whats wrong with that as long as it can be more scratch resistant than metal and adds more featureslike qipma wireless charging its upgrade unless its more easy to breaktalking about samsung s8 and note 8
LGV30;MrMobile;yeet;pointless guy i just dont like glass backs it looks like jewelry
LGV30;MrMobile;POINTLESS GUY;yeet actually lg doesnt make fragile back glass phones their glass phones are actually surprisingly durable unlike the s8which got many reviewers complaining about the back cracking just after a week like jaime rivera the lg g6 actually stands very well for abuse some people havent even broke the back of the phone jaime rivera was so disappointed with the durability of the s8 he got a lg g6 and brought it for like 3 months without breaking the back the lg g6 and v30 are also mgstd810g making it drop and shock resistant solar radiation resistant and salt resistantwtf anyway lg v30 is also ip68 water and dust resistant although it is made of glass lg still makes durable phonesunlike galaxy note 8 and s8

LGV30;MrMobile;SavageArfad;has a nice camera but wait for the price there‚Äôs also the fingerprint sensor placement the poor enough bottom facing speaker and it doesn‚Äôt come with oreo which it should the quad dac wasn‚Äôt that impressive on the v6 feels light in the hand from reports
LGV30;MrMobile;Abner Chilson;sma das yes if i were ever to get an iphone id probably get the 6s
LGV30;MrMobile;doge.;iphone 7 is way thinner tbh
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;almost as slim smaller in general though offers bigger cameras a better dac more battery wireless charging multiple protection a jack and manages to be over 30g lighter d
LGV30;MrMobile;Sma Das;chris li hence the reason i chose the 6s over the 7
LGV30;MrMobile;Sma Das;abner chilson not useless its surprising useful when i upgraded from the note 5 to the 6s but when the seven came out i felt no reason to upgrade since the 6s has more than the 7 excluding the chipset and camera so 6s7 in my opinion
LGV30;MrMobile;Chris Li;abner chilson i would rather have a smaller taptic engine and a headphone jack
LGV30;MrMobile;Sich weza;abner chilson agreed
LGV30;MrMobile;Abner Chilson;sma das id rather have a headphone jack than a freakin useless taptic engine
LGV30;MrMobile;Sma Das;sich weza agreed although the majority of the loss incurred from jack was transferred to the taptic engine
LGV30;MrMobile;Alexandru Ciorda≈ü;sich weza i agree but the iphone 7 is almost 1 year old though
LGV30;MrMobile;hamode mu;bo üò¢
LGV30;MrMobile;The Original Martian;i mean theres innovation huh
LGV30;MrMobile;Rob Ctrc;don sandoval and a hifi dac as well lmao
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;slendermarc youve never used a 35mm audio jack ever are you fucking serious
LGV30;MrMobile;MobileDecay;slendermarc dont lie you have an iphone 7 i mean i could understand if you were into horse porn to each their own but having an iphone you should be ashamed of yourself üôÑ
LGV30;MrMobile;Frank Wong;slendermarc people like different things i love the headphone jack always use it cause i dont want to deal with the hassle of recharging my wireless headphones
LGV30;MrMobile;SlenderMarc;mobiledecay i dont and ive never used a headphone jack i hate to carry cables in my pocket
LGV30;MrMobile;MobileDecay;slendermarc you sir have an iphone 7 üò≤üò≤üò≤
LGV30;MrMobile;SlenderMarc;don sandoval at this point if a phone company puts 5 headphone jacks on the phone people are gonna say oh my god thats great revolutionary technology
LGV30;MrMobile;Spooky Psyche;and its a high quality one at that i love lg
LGV30;MrMobile;HenryS;sheldon white r u blind
LGV30;MrMobile;Pratyush Chandra;don sandoval maybe no dac for statesü§í who knowsü§ß
LGV30;MrMobile;sheldon white;don sandoval there is no headphone jack
LGV30;MrMobile;Lukel;saw9 i personally prefer it on the top as i always put my phone bottom facing down in my pocket but in the end a headphone jack is a headphone jack
LGV30;MrMobile;Gautam Diwan;don sandoval that too with a good quad dac‚ò∫
LGV30;MrMobile;iSkLaMoWsYoN;i heard it will bundled with a bo earphone
LGV30;MrMobile;Dumtiedum;saw9 not more annoying than using a dongle
LGV30;MrMobile;SAW9;and its on the top quite annoying in the pocket
LGV30;MrMobile;ruzaqir rachman;sad thing we lose replacable battery i stil love lg v20 tho and second is very usefull to me
LGV30;MrMobile;BTICronox;because the battery is better protected to not go up in flames same as in the g6 which would have 3600mah without that protection battery life should be pretty good though
LGV30;MrMobile;Aditya Gulati;atleast is thin and much lighter than the super heavy and expensive note 8 with a smaller screen and better cameras
LGV30;MrMobile;Ahmad Debian;nyan spider and why cant we have bigger batteries  efficiency especially when it is duable with older phones with 3600 and 4000 mah then why on earth cant we have both and finally push batteries to 2 days instead of its an amazing battery that stayed till the end of the day
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;ahmad debian more battery efficient technology  the g6 has average battery life as it is and the v30 has an poled display and a snapdragon 835 both of which make battery more efficient  with oreo coming to it soon it will have amazing battery life
LGV30;MrMobile;Ahmad Debian;mr whose the boss i wrote it 3000 by mistake 3300 is still disappointing to me because it is a phablet with a big size and the v30 has no spen so what is their excuse now
LGV30;MrMobile;JibaroTech;true thats going to be the achilles heel when the honor mate 10 comes with 4000mah
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin Beast;the battery is 3300 mah but youre right manufacturers could do better with battery size
LGV30;MrMobile;Mr whose the boss;ahmad debian its 3300mah
LGV30;MrMobile;david G;tilted by box nope im good with  my s8 plus im on top of food chain already
LGV30;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;better camera socwill make battery better better screen wireless chargind and quad dack maybe if you have g6 theres no point but if you dont its far better
LGV30;MrMobile;Raize;david g lol wtf u are talking about shit that barely anyone has or needs in a phone
LGV30;MrMobile;Tj Flex;hellomoto its similar to how the g2 was which means this phone is awesome üí™üèæüí™üèæüí™üèæ
LGV30;MrMobile;√âsxatosFox;
LGV30;MrMobile;Marauder Shields;yeah thats just what we need more indians with thick accents making videos
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;brown bobby same as lg ui cmiiw but i think u never use newer lg phone or even u never use lg i used to have s6e s7e s8e and on lg i have g4 and now v20 u know g4 is bloated with features and v20 its cleaner now features v20 has build in equalizer software for the audio playback tunning with hifi option ir blaster for ur phone to make it as remoteg6 and v30 lose this like s7e and s8 lg health like samsung health manual mode on still image and video and other its like samsung
LGV30;MrMobile;Phillip Pugh;brown bobby everyone but you i guess
LGV30;MrMobile;brown bobby;who says samsungs ui is packed with features
LGV30;MrMobile;Thisath Ranawaka;ryfol im so surprised that lg skin actually doesnt look too bad this time
LGV30;MrMobile;‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢;ryfol u r living in cave kid
LGV30;MrMobile;Gagan Shrestha;badeia 1 sror why
LGV30;MrMobile;Badeia 1 Sror;gagan shrestha nope
LGV30;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;actually my gfs g4 8mp takes worse photos than the g6
LGV30;MrMobile;TheTrulynice1412;alex de la rosa which is crazy cause up til the g6 lg used a 8mp front shooterand it was actually really goodso idk why they downgradedmaybe cost efficiency ü§î
LGV30;MrMobile;Nyan Spider;mistpassiert its getting it in october though  not only that but it has the google tremble thing so itll get updates faster than it used to
LGV30;MrMobile;Mist Passiert;the ram management on the v20 is shit i imagine the v30 will be the same and if you want to see android 80 anytime in the life of the device dont plan on it from lg my v20 is still on 70 not even 710
LGV30;MrMobile;Jhin;mrrane unless u wanna multitask one game and one browser almost runs u dry dont forget ram can be use as a disk
LGV30;MrMobile;Kravence;smh we need better optimisation not more ram
LGV30;MrMobile;FOX;mark martin horrible argument sorry
LGV30;MrMobile;mark martin;harry starzec a one plus 5 has 8 and is faster then the iphone 7 thoughüòÇüòÇüòÇ
LGV30;MrMobile;Swae Lee;i hope youre joking
LGV30;MrMobile;Dude Lmao;jesus people are taking large amounts of ram for granted im pretty sure basically all apps are able to run fine on 4 gb of ram in fact i rarely have troubles with my 3gb ram nexus 6p the 6 gigs on things like the note 8 only really come into their own in multitasking
LGV30;MrMobile;Mow Better Lawn Service;harry starzec thats what im saying my honor 8 flies and it only uses 27 gb of ram out of its 4 total lol
LGV30;MrMobile;Harry Starzec;4gb done right is better than 8gb done wrong you can go buy a crappy android phone off a chinese market with 6 or 8gb of ram but it runs slower than an iphone which only has 3gb optimization is worth a lot more than the number and ram isnt the most important spec they all have to work together for a seamless experience and consistently positive results
LGV30;MrMobile;Patrick;jibarotech optimization can only get you so far more ram will be needed for smartphones in the future
LGV30;MrMobile;JibaroTech;dennis bareis if you get better optimization youll get more efficient operation plus better battery life if they increase ram and that works google and the oem will never optimize their software and just get away with adding ram and is going to be a moment where we are going to have 16gb of ram in a phone that the res is 2k in a 6 screen and is a complete overkill
LGV30;MrMobile;Random Projectiles;do u even know how ram mgmt works
LGV30;MrMobile;Patrick;laurensius satya 6gb of ram imo should be on every upcoming flagship more ram  more idling apps
LGV30;MrMobile;Mow Better Lawn Service;dennis bareis which phone do you have that uses more than 3gbs of ram i hardly even touch 3gbs
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;what why need 6 or 8 gb and i actually asking is sd 835 is really need to get better performance on the phone i mean game what game repetitive ps2 quality game u can do it on sd 800 which is old and 6gb for whaaat if phone optimize its hardware it cand do great u can get 8gb ram and it can be bad look s6 case it has aggressive ram management that it can only run 2 apps at the same time now my experience with lg g4 and v20 that they have good optimisation their ram management it not that aggressive
LGV30;MrMobile;Farhat Bamadhaj;the phenomenal one sure i am using the same op3 but damn the ram management sucks what os you use
LGV30;MrMobile;FOX;james lee he‚Äôs sarcastic
LGV30;MrMobile;FOX;mrrane keep in mind that phone ram is a bit different than pc ram
LGV30;MrMobile;mark martin;the phenomenal one i have a 3 also and your bullshiting i got it a week after it came out and it was only using 4gb but after the patch i noticed a huge boost in multitasking performance
LGV30;MrMobile;Red Tha Producer;rezaimranninetyeight¬Æ how
LGV30;MrMobile;RezaImranNinetyEight¬Æ;justin beast this is an s8 rip off
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin Beast;lakshya kapila ye its better
LGV30;MrMobile;Mabirc;ruben pramatya no but you‚Äòre a moron
LGV30;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;zorkor yeah i agree iphone 8 will blow any high specs smartphones after all iphone 8 has headphone jack yeah  wait  fuck
LGV30;MrMobile;flames 8889;taner ali to say that an iphone has no functionality is completely ignorant i own five android flagships an iphone 7 plus and am an it pm in telecom if the iphone has no functionality then why do many companies issue iphones as their work device why do devs focus on ios apps and not their android counterpart
LGV30;MrMobile;flames 8889;zorkor i‚Äôm no it won‚Äôt and my daily is a 7 plus the reason it won‚Äôt is because it depends on what a user needs from their phone having said that i‚Äôm done with lg i‚Äôve have two v20s and they both have issues all my prior lg phones have had issues it‚Äôs safe to say the gods don‚Äôt want me using an lg device
LGV30;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;allan carcamo sameeeeeeeeee
LGV30;MrMobile;bokunotraplord;if all you want is the camera you can get the v20 for much cheaper
LGV30;MrMobile;Allan Carcamo;hes just an idiot i have an iphone 7 plus but i love the camera features of the v30 thats why i wanna get it
LGV30;MrMobile;alex diew;because u cant afford note 8 and iphone 8
LGV30;MrMobile;Mabirc;dad on duty 899‚Ç¨ here
LGV30;MrMobile;Mabirc;lewis 89 iphone 8 uses the same design as the last 3 years
LGV30;MrMobile;Chen Ming Liang;zorkor you only mean the sales number heh
LGV30;MrMobile;dad on duty;same i want the lg g6 but now i have to wait until this beauty available in my country i guess just hoping the price tag not in the range of note 8 tho
LGV30;MrMobile;Lewis 89;mabirc apple is innovative yes for using same design for 3 years and ditching the headphone jack
LGV30;MrMobile;Mabirc;allan carcamo why not wait 2 weeks for the iphone 8 it might not be as durable or as great audio but its going to be the most innovative and most interesting phone this year especially compared to the boring samsung releases
LGV30;MrMobile;Hector G.;zorkor  you can the iphone will blow everyone but with that price tag limited hardware and features the iphone better blow someone
LGV30;MrMobile;David hunsinger;zorkor except theres phones that are faster than the s8 but yea lets go with that
LGV30;MrMobile;Whimsical Mage3;zorkor yea you dumbass
LGV30;MrMobile;Taner Ali;zorkor a phone that is 1 seconds faster that has no functionality and customization and a locked down os is not good
LGV30;MrMobile;Justin Beast;zorkor of course you know nothing about phones
LGV30;MrMobile;Froogy Master;same bro
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;james lee htc sense
LGV30;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;kingslayer my g2 g3 and g4 never ever had any of these issues
LGV30;MrMobile;James Lee;all this talk about optimization when the f does any android skin optimize ram really well honestly on android i fell like the more ram the better unless youre ios
LGV30;MrMobile;Anthony J;goze a yeah the v20 was a disappointed tho it was basically just a v10 with a different body bit faster cpugpu and a different camera slightly improved audio and charging but everything else pretty much stayed the same
LGV30;MrMobile;Anthony J;remixedvoice why root anyway the v10 has nougat on all models and g4 has it on korean and international models and nougat is super quick and the lg skin actually isnt too bad esp considering there are themes to almost completely change the ui look
LGV30;MrMobile;Tigerex966;just 6gb ram vs 4 and 128gb storage vs 64 not sure if it will be in all markets as far asa i can toilsome audio and cameras screen size and everybody else
LGV30;MrMobile;JakeTheFakeReal;the form factor some people prefer smaller phones and keeping the models half a year or so apart spring vs fall lets lg stay relevant yearround
LGV30;MrMobile;Mow Better Lawn Service;remixedvoice for real i just feel like they want to put out another phone bigger for functionality like samsung did with the note line the problem now is that lg is now doing a plus line too  i heard something exclusive for the audio was going to be for the plus version also like the audio tuning maybe like the v20 was for the korean or international model something i hope not
LGV30;MrMobile;RemixedVoice;anthony morado whats the point of the g line if the v line is superior in every way
LGV30;MrMobile;RemixedVoice;kingslayer uhh ive owned every g line phone never had any problems or bootloops  and bootloops were fixed with the g4 and v10 lmao they dont happen anymore dont root your phone if you dont know what youre doing
LGV30;MrMobile;Kingslayer;anthony morado be careful with lg after a few months looks good now some random flaw starts happening later usually hardwarerelated like bootloops bad gps receiver image retention etc the software skin lg ux doesnt help it age any better
LGV30;MrMobile;Deathstroke 87;anthony morado can you wait for it to bootloop ‚ò∫
LGV30;MrMobile;Christopher Gai;savagearfad how is the fingerprint placement an issue i own a g6which has pretty much the same positioning and i have no problems at all i find it more convenient than even a front facing fingerprint sensor
LGV30;MrMobile;SavageArfad;it has a nice camera but wait for the price there‚Äôs also the fingerprint sensor placement the poor enough bottom facing speaker and it doesn‚Äôt come with oreo which it should the quad dac wasn‚Äôt that impressive on the v6 build quality not the best from reports
LGV30;MrMobile;Mow Better Lawn Service;anthony morado small battery though and its not removable
LGV30;MrMobile;Goze A.;the v line has actually always sold well especially the v10 and v20 in the us its the g series that suffers
LGV30;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;daniel pickering cant wait for this to be released the price of the g6 should drop and maybe i will get it
LGV30;MrMobile;Daniel Pickering;anthony morado this is probably the best phone that no one is going to buy lg as always will mess up the advertising for this phone like they did with the g6 v20 g5 v10 the iphone 8 will cost 200 more and still sell 10x the amount of this phone im glad lg had a go but their fighting an up hill battle
LGV30;MrMobile;Tech Defender;ddd bbb from my experience it lags more often then my s8 plus for example in snapchat on v20 its not very smooth scrolling between camera and snaps i guess it isnt as optimized as s8
LGV30;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;i have v20 and its super fast  and still fast after a whole year and awesome device  and i even like lg ui  but my problem was the screen sensetivity its get scratch easily from keys in my pocket  and my screen now is fucked
LGV30;MrMobile;Tech Defender;taner ali the camera quality battery life and how sluggish it got after 3 months coming from an s7 edge owner i was anxiously waiting for s8 plus which i have now it has the better camera battery life and it hasnt lagged in the areas where the v20 did however i enjoyedmiss the quad dac and the wide angle cam
LGV30;MrMobile;Neil DeVo;the v20 is a better phone than the v30  why would you pay way more for less features no ir blasteruse it all the time  and no removable battery so you can take the phone in water great get an iphone 7 or an s8 model  if this phone isnt 49999 its not worth it
LGV30;MrMobile;Taner Ali;tech defender what was bad about it
LGV30;MrMobile;Mist Passiert;nope no bootloop instead a battery life issue my v20 has been warranty exchanged 3 times or battery life degradation to 1525 hours of screen on time in addition to other issues i had screen burn in happening after 3 months on one device and a stuck pixel annoying as hell on a 750 device on another i have already preordered my note 8 and cant wait
LGV30;MrMobile;Richard Walden;integrada87 devices with the 808810 g4 v10 5x 6p were the most prone to the bootloops as they shared the same arm cortex architecture which qualcomm rushed to production without altering devices with the older 801 g3 and newer 820 v20 have suffered bootloops to a much lesser extent as they have different processor architecture modified and optimised to some extent by qualcomm
LGV30;MrMobile;integraDA87;richard walden then why only did the lg 810 bootloop and not only the 810 but 820 and 808 believe me i was like you saying the bootloop issue was no big deal til it happened to me 6 months after i purchased me device
LGV30;MrMobile;Richard Walden;sean reeves i had a g3 and am currently still using my 6p with no bootloops on either i guess i got lucky as ive ran both the batteries into the ground and the phones have got hella hot at times i wouldnt think twice about buying another phone from lg the bootloop fault is not lgs fault but qualcomms they rushed their octacore 810 chips to the market using stock arm design architecture rather than their own usual modified kryo architecture and the resultant chips werent fit for purpose  there had been rumours of the snapdragon 810s over heating before release hence why samsung made the wise design to omit them that year and use their exynos chips for that generation of phone qualcomm said they had revised the chip 810 v21 and solved the over heating but they clearly didnt as so many different manufacturers devices with these chips suffered bootloops
LGV30;MrMobile;integraDA87;lg g flex 2 bootlooped went on lg website to try and get it repaired and they didnt even have it listed so now it sits there in the darkest of sock drawers
LGV30;MrMobile;Joe Sanders;thisath ranawaka wrong ive had 2 v10s that bootlooped this problem has not been solved
LGV30;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;i wouldnt have a problem with lg if they acknowledged and replaced my two bootlooped g4s but they didnt verizon replaced the first one then couldnt for the second since the second was out of warranty and it pisses me off they may make decent products now but they have nowhere near the customer support samsung had with the note 7 so they can go suck it for all i care
LGV30;MrMobile;Sean Reeves;richard walden never had any random reboots on any of my lg phones but i had three nexus 6ps in a row that did it really bad
LGV30;MrMobile;Kingslayer;en force my g5 and v20 has no bootlooping but that image retention also my g5 has minor lightbleed on top noticed it last night while my v20 lags as bad as samsung if i use it for tethering stutter galore while it overheats  im just not sure with lg anymore their quality for the long term is questionable i still love my g5 and v20 but may end up avoiding samsung and lg forever  personally i dont want any phone including a 1000 iphone 8 or whatever i want the 185 jordan xxx3 been fascinated with sneakers again and they do increase in value this v30 drops to 400 in a couple months  air jordans have a unique design every single year smartphones do not plan to buy two pairs one to wear and the other for display and sell after a few years
LGV30;MrMobile;Tyler Travis;all five of my lg g4s had a bootloop problem
LGV30;MrMobile;Richard Walden;the bootloop problem plagued more devices than just the g4 the root cause of it was a design flaw with some of qualcomms 8xx series chips causing the big cores to fail mainly the snapdragon 808810 the nexus 6p and 5x also both suffered  from this problem although mine is fine so far touch wood
LGV30;MrMobile;En Force;jorge munoz yea g3g4g5v10 and maybe v20 had bootlooping but g6 and v30 certainly dont have it people who said that need to get their head out of ass
LGV30;MrMobile;Laurensius Satya;lee cason v20 problem is not that huge dude i mean i have xperia z1 it has bootloop problem in my 1st week so no phone is safe replace it i have g4 and v20 so far so great no bootloop and its like saying note 7 is exploding then 1 note 8 exploding people going crazy saying ohhhhh they make another grenade boooommm   sure v20 bootloop for some people but its not like g4 or v10 it is fixed in g5 but ofc it still has some malfunction devices not all human made is perfect
LGV30;MrMobile;Jorge Munoz;johnny pigman maybe one broke  replaced it
LGV30;MrMobile;Lee Cason;thisath ranawaka incorrect lg g5 and v20 had bootloop problems
LGV30;MrMobile;Johnny Pigman;reetwick tunga if none of the 3 of your lg g4 units have boot looped then why the heck do you need to use 3  i mean isnt it a sign of boot loop considering you have to use 3 of them instead of just 1
LGV30;MrMobile;Jorge Munoz;thisath ranawaka im currently on the v20 and its flawless
LGV30;MrMobile;reetwick tunga;i used 3 lg g4 none of them had a boot loop and you are right everywhere i see people bitching about bootloop
LGV30;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;allyssa alejandro ok sry then
LGV30;MrMobile;Thisath Ranawaka;jorge munoz its gone now phones havent bootlooping since the v10
LGV30;MrMobile;Rey F;that said mr mobiles review was way better imo

LGV30;MrMobile;RemixedVoice;mariano ramirez acevedo aww how cute you have a crush on mr mobile üíã
LGV30;MrMobile;varaprasad sb;is it confirmed the size of the damn sensor is 13 thats smaller than that of the v20
LGV30;MrMobile;Rob Ctrc;tejas murthy for real and it shoots log omg
LGV30;MrMobile;oli tala;note 8  v30  v20 user
LGV30;MrMobile;lorone one;rachmat w rafe true bigger sensor
LGV30;MrMobile;kim nas;sony lense
LGV30;MrMobile;rachmat w. rafe;too bad sensor size is just 13 compared to 125 on htc u11 and also pixel size 11um vs 14um make its f16 obsolete ill go with f17 and bigger sensor anyday dont be ignorant and become sheeps
LGV30;MrMobile;Esti Robertson;slavomir g this is true but it is wrong to say the aperture means nothing hdr technology is getting so good that even the it can take good photos in the dark even just adding more light even those not noticable my the human eye is going to make an impact on the photo quality in a good way sure the aperture is the best spec on a camera but it is an important one when paired with the right specs like right megapixels lens size  and all that good stuff all this stuff combined is going to make the photo quality better and better than last year and the year before
LGV30;MrMobile;Pety;slavomir g the f stop is one of many factors that can help the smartphone camera its not a make or break thing obviously but it can help
LGV30;MrMobile;Slavomir G;exactly the opposite the f doesnt mean anything because in a smartphone camera there are indeed other more important things that decide on photo quality for example size and quality of the sensor not to be cofused with number of megapixels which also doesnt mean anything and sizequality of the glass elements to a less extent software code to put it simple the realpractical quality of components is important not theoretical values put in a spec sheet
LGV30;MrMobile;Pety;slavomir g im not disagreeing with your conclusion rn but the example you gave doesnt really prove anything there are so many other factors that could lead to that situation you act like there isnt more than one spec that makes a camera good
LGV30;MrMobile;Slavomir G;exactly as invisiman is saying the f doesnt mean shit in world of smartphone photography i have f19 on my galaxy a5 and the photos are worse quality and much darker than photos from my lumia 950 which also had f19 in conclusion it means nothing
LGV30;MrMobile;Esti Robertson;yes yes the aperture of the phone is the largest ever is should capture a tiny bit more light then last years phones and lg really stepped up the camera big time and no doubt this has a better camera than the s8 iphone 7 and 7 the only real competitors this phone camera wise is the google pixel and the galaxy note 8 i  believe the camera is the best so far on a smartphone especially that manual mode
LGV30;MrMobile;ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ≥ŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ;yes yes that thing is 2cm thick dude and a 1inch sensor is nowhere near ff
LGV30;MrMobile;Yes Yes;ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ≥ŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ it has been done before with panasonic cm1 but its more like a camera with android built in that can make calls lol bulky
LGV30;MrMobile;ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ Œ≥ŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ;invisiman so why dont you go down there at lg and show them how to fit a full frame sensor in a v30 just show them how its done
LGV30;MrMobile;Yes Yes;invisiman so its all about the sensor size what is the sensor size on v30 and what do you think reasonable sensor could be fitted on a flagship im really trying to figure out how to tell if a camera is great
LGV30;MrMobile;InvisiMan;unfortunately the sensor size is shit so that f16 is mostly a marketing gimmick
LGV30;MrMobile;Pety;jtflicks well duh nobody expected a shallow dof from a selfie youre not going to get blurred backgrounds anywhere that other phones wouldnt but in situations that other phones normally do which you can do on a smartphone camera the effect will look better
LGV30;MrMobile;JTflicks;that dof should be almost infinite for anything but macro photograhy the hyperfocal distance closest distance you can set the focus to get far field objects in focus is less than 20cm which means even at selfie distance everything is is focus and the dof is near infinte all the soft bokeh from phones is either objects that are 520cm from the lens or is digitally added
LGV30;MrMobile;Pety;that dof should look great

LGV30;MrMobile;Martin Eugeniev;before i watched pocketnow because of michael fisher and jaime river but now i only go there becuase of jaime rivera and here because of mrmobile d
LGV30;MrMobile;Gaj B;i stopped going to pocketnow because of all their ads the site is a mess
LGV30;MrMobile;Minh Pham;you know what comparing them is a silly thing to do
LGV30;MrMobile;Soldier-2Point0;sean reeves michael fisher is doing great he continues to gain subscribers as people learn he has a new channel i stopped following pocketnow because i just watched jaime riveras videos and it really felt like a chore i watch anything mr mobile uploads because he thought it would be worth the time to create the content pocketnow felt like they had to create anything in order to have consistent uploads
LGV30;MrMobile;Travis Sivart;its me i did the same thing yesterday
LGV30;MrMobile;Sean Reeves;its me i find both to be worse off without each other a mr mobile video sort of almost feels like an old micheal pocketnow video but some times not quite and everything is more focused on the device hands on i liked seeing him more and more footage of him outside doing things comparing phones you need help for some things  and of course the pocketnow podcast is so bad without michael they should have stayed together i dont know why some people feel the need to ditch a successful channel and think they can do it all by themselves and collect 100 of the profits ego as far as solo channels go micheal isnt even in the top 5 i say this as a big micheal fan but i also am honest hes a better collaborator and team leader than lone wolf
LGV30;MrMobile;Vanine;michael fisher is great reviewer and personally one of my favs since the days of pocketnow but i honestly feel that most of his recent fans can give people the wrong image about his brand in general with their comments that seem to directly put down other tech youtubers
LGV30;MrMobile;Jake Huyett;they are still riding the coattails of his success
LGV30;MrMobile;Roshin Nishad;sometimes mr mobile is just worth it
LGV30;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;its me sameeeeeeeeee
LGV30;MrMobile;Vanine;you know its possible to show your love for your fav content creator without putting down others
LGV30;MrMobile;Matteo Ursini;bundy hanson theres an embargo since reviewers had these samples before the presentation

LGV30;MrMobile;wayne launer;ilya chap lol if you ever think so lol  no phones can replace note series for me and my family  not even the galaxy s series
LGV30;MrMobile;josh heredia;ilya chap yes the fingerprint sensor is more better placed than the note 8 but not others but yeah  the screen however goes to note 8  and the pen isnt forced its optional   the other stuff i cant really say as ive havent use them but those that i mentioned are the obvious facts
LGV30;MrMobile;Ilya Chap;josh heredia v30 looks better without useless pencurved screen fingerprint scanner is reachable has more features in camera appbetter audio experiencebetter rear camerassmaller screen
LGV30;MrMobile;josh heredia;ilya chap  the note 8 has better specs
