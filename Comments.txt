iPhoneX;MrMobile;ahmed samir;before i was really in believe with your honesty reviews  after this one i am not sure any more subscribe removed bye
iPhoneX;MrMobile;fr0z3nmechanix;i really enjoy how objective your videos are theyre not just a raging angry bash fest
iPhoneX;MrMobile;F D;should i get iphone or samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;G-briell XD;nope
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike Lechner;you dont care for baseball i almost unsubscribed from your channel for that remark
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Langley;mostly im glad iphone users finally are getting things ive enjoyed for years with samsung phones like amazing oled screens higher res and wireless charging something that makes the pixel a no go for my next upgrade since they dont support that  of course they only get most of it in a 999 phone vs androids offering these things at various price points much cheaper  as far as the whole apple does things better than others not really at least not any more than any other company  every once in a while they hit that on something but then they miss on many other things or at least dont improve upon them  samsung has done this sort of thing forever  fast charging wireless charging wireless fast charging  oled screens from them each year pushing the bounds of screen quality  stylus support in a phone i mean a wacom digitizer and a stylus that can support 4k levels of sensitivity  the list goes on  other phone makers have their things too and if we go into software the list outside apple gets even bigger like multitasking  things android and its various skins did better and still do much better than ios  yet there still sits this perception that once every couple years apple gets one thing right and somehow that makes it their story  really their best talent is great marketing and realizing if you repeat self praise youll convince people its true  additionally though the face tracking stuff is interesting the tech behind it is not nearly as mind blowing as apple pitches it  nearly all the type of tech its using is behind the samsung iris scanner  the iphone x uses an ir camera ir illuminator basically a simple ir light projector and an ir dot projector not that different than the illuminator projecting dots is quite simple  the samsung has an ir camera  ir illuminator  so it just has one less ir projector thats it  it will be interesting to see how it performs in daylight for the same ir reasons you mentioned in your video though active tracking might help balance it  all those other sensors on the apple marketing are standard and have been on all smartphones forever  most manufacturers just dont over hype stuff quite that mundane but apple has no shame lol  in fact the s8 s8 and note 8 have it topped in total count they are the first phones to offer ambient light sensors on the front and back of the phone something key since your body can shade the sensor on the front and throw off the input a heart rate monitor pulse oximeter and of course on the note 8 we have a full wacom digitizer built in  unfortunately most people dont realize that the tech talked about is actually pretty mundane even if the application might be interesting  whats also interesting is the pc mmorpg everquest 2 supported face tracked avatars in their game since 2012 a whole 5 years ago it works quite well search youtube for soemote and only uses basic webcams no ir camerasprojectors needed  it makes a lot more sense for something like that where you are playing an avatar on a large screen  on a phone why not just use your actual face to talk with people rather than face track it onto poop lol  the facial recognition login is probably the best use for the tech and in the end it wont make a difference to most users if its a bit more secure than the ones other offers  if you really are worried about someone stealing your phone and they already have a high res picture of you to login to your phone well you have bigger problems lol and businesses have often still required pin codes even with biometrics on phones  the reality is you can change a pin or a password but you cant change your face or your fingerprint so someone simply needs to figure out how to fake it once and its done for  this is why in the moviesshows that use biometrics for super secret government facilities also require a passcode on top of them  its not about easy of use its about multiple layers  unfortunately many simply believe the apple marketing if they say this is the first oled screen good enough for an iphone then most of their users will believe it despite the fact samsung oleds have been beating iphone lcds for many years now including color accuracy many dont realize samsung phones have screen modes and the default one purposely increases the color space but you can set it to basic to have a very accurate srgb color space  in any case good video  it is good to see these things finally make it to iphones i genuinely am happy they are getting some of these excellent things that have worked quite well for years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Flo grown manny;i had the palm pre plus i loved the ui on that phone it was way ahead of its time

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Clement Siby;i see nothing here that justifies a 1000 price mr mobile has made a commendable effort to placate apple fans who have been disappointed by the lack of innovation and progress by apple

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dorian Thomas;anybody who thinks this iphone isnt¬†selling out in seconds is smoking crack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Scheff;facial recognition thus far has been pretty annoying it feels unnatural to hold something in front of my face typically when i unlock my phone its leaving my pocket in my passenger seat or on my night stand its fun for about 10 minutes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;H0001 G;this guys full of shit did he not see face aid fail i have the note 8 iris is quicker than finger print

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Johnfortich Vista;running on a tech from 34 years ago and similar to other phones of less than a quarter of the price its a branding thing catered for zombie idiots
iPhoneX;MrMobile;cultusdeus;all the swipes should make blackberry positively furious what was bb10 except a series of swipes halfway up and to the right to see all your incoming contacts in one thread and one glance
iPhoneX;MrMobile;peachees;apple  needs to copy  i mean invent the blackberry hub and then im  a user
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tim Hall;face scanning is cool but think about the privacy implications too
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bharat Gupta;like for including sony üòâ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Darium;iris scanner is till more secure than face id if wont unlock the phone if you have an evil twin plus it failed in the demo ffs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fernando Alba;sony need to suit for that x belongs to xperia

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joseph Tossoukpe;hello i really loved the reference to webos which was for me the best mobile os of all time as you said many of the features we now see on our phones come from there and only a few tech people remember thanks for the video though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jayden Dickson;all spot on and you managed to defend the swipe up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Damilare Omotimehin;iphone x copy samsung design httpswwwphonecorridorcom201709iphonexprice

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Louie Sucayan;101 that scratch on the apple logo got me real good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Salvatore DeLorenzo;i know it‚Äôs the most popular platform but the update to the software looks geared towards children and elderly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NERO;lucky for others is 1k in the philippines it will be selling 2k we call it dutertenomics fcking government
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ISubscribeToYou3;my s8 is perfectionfuck this crap
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar Cardenas;what a bunch of crapive using wireless charging for years to the envy of iphone users and it is already widely popular it would be decent from you to say what  you are forced to pay if you want to use features like fast or wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Stanford;ha use that watch for calling and see what happens lmao battery life is 1 hour if you do
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John M Edmondson;oh and thanks michael for a great intro to the iphone x  easily the best ive seen yet must be that fellow star trek fan in you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John M Edmondson;hi michael as an android user currently a s8 i am really glad to see apple back in the game and still providing real competition for android as you rightly point out there is nothing truly original in what the iphone x offers but having diverted some much of their engineering and other staff for such a long time to this product there is little doubt that it will raise the bar in certain areas for its competitors and we all benefit from that so whether you are going to buy one or not be grateful for those that do because they make things better for all of us by inspiring the samsungs and the lgs and so forth to also raise the bar in kind and then we all benefit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;C√©dric Joly;awesome editorial michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeremy Stock;great vid michael  would love more on the samsung note 8  some follow up to your prior reviews
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kim Wendel Medrano;notchgate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;xxNATHANUKxx;so why not get an 8 plus and save some money only thing you are missing is the face id and some anamoji shit which you dont need
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;only 3gb ram when ios11 is catered only to 64bit apps will be the xs greatest weakness in the long run shouldve been 4gb the iphone 5s is already showing its age with ios11 with just 1gb  moroccan blue lg v30 for me or forget another cookie cutter smartphone altogether too quick to die on us 23 yrs tops better get a nintendo switch with the mario odyssey bundle instead my jordan 7 retros lasted longer than my smartphones 5 yrs vs 23  fuckplannedobsolescence

iPhoneX;MrMobile;n8neiTen8n;welcome to 2008 apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;k2hsharpe;re your enthusiasm for gesture control your top of list feature that apple is improving if i swipe down from the top with 1 finger i get my most used onoff toggles for things such as wifi location bluetooth screen brightness etc plus my chosen notifications plus settings  two finger swipe down gives me access to the full 19 controls plus notifications plus settings  the order of these 19 controls are customisable if i swipe in from diagonally opposing corners it brings up my 3 home screens where i can add  delete home screens and access wallpapers widgets and my settings if i swipe in from the left i get access to the 2 edge screens i‚Äôve chosen ‚Äì 1 for 5 of my favourite contacts with notifications and 1 for 5 apps i‚Äôve chosen to place there like currency app calculator conversions app etc all these pretty standard i guess  but everything from now on i‚Äôve pretty much chosen what the action will do  ‚Ä¶ on my bottom task bar i‚Äôve placed my choice of 4 app icons for sms gmail contacts and phone app  plus an icon for the app drawer  touching the app drawer icon calls up my apps which i‚Äôve chosen to have scroll vertically   if i swipe up from the app drawer i open the settings for my launcher if i swipe up from the lower part of the screen with a single finger it calls up my ir universal remote control  at the moment i have it programmed for a samsung tv a yamaha av receiver and a panasonic bluray  pvr if i single finger swipe down from the upper part of the screen it opens up my news magazine  a 2 finger swipe down opens my torch a double tap on a home screen calls up and starts my sound recorder currently set to record in high quality wav files a single press to my home button takes me back to my last home screen  a double press calls up my camera  a triple press changes the screen to bw to conserve power thing is i‚Äôve had my last 2 phones programmed to do most of this and that‚Äôs over the past 4 and a half years  i seriously haven‚Äôt a clue why you think a few rudimentary swipe gestures is special enough to make it to your list of features you claim apple does better let alone number 1
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris Malaspinas;this is a step into future in my opinion every company is just trying to make their phones faster and better looking instead apple and i cant believe im saying this is looking forward by adding some touches defying what the world needs like right now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Heng Theng;if it 1000 in my country i will 100 buy it but it not it fucking 1700 or 1900 ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Xinhao Wang;nice screen bad design wont buy it at all im switching to android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;#S8PlusIs Boss;the galaxy iphone8 and iphone8 as well as the galaxy iphone x are nothing more than wannabe samsung bootleg hack products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;L Weezy;samaung all day
iPhoneX;MrMobile;It's Akile;kinda hard to think face id is far worst than touch id or why do it touch id is great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrea Salmon;note 8 is 1300
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrea Salmon;every saying the i phone 8 is too much money what about the note 8 is 1300 dollarss
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Christopher Smith;michael does anyone have any idea if apples wireless charging is the slow version like it was rumored to be ie i dont know the technical specifics but it was supposed to be half the speed of what is currently available ¬†we had the rumor of the slower speed wireless charging then we had the release and everyone just saying it has wireless charging with no mention of the speedis that because we just dont know yet ¬†thanks man ¬†love your vids
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;best iphone designs ever 1 55sse 2 44s 3 2g 4 x 5 7 6 8 7 66s 8 3g3gs 9 5c  i believe my space gray iphone se is the best iphone ever made insideout i still prefer the design of my glacial silver htc one m7 more but i prefer using my se way more but since i dont like that ios lacks launchers that i would only rank it among my 3 fav  favorites lg v20 lg g5 apple iphone se google pixel samsung galaxy s7 edge motorola moto e 4g  v20 moved up from 3 g5 went down to 2 v20 really is the better phone se moved up a couple spots because its so small and beautiful easy to carry pixel was 2 mostly and 1 at some point bland design no real standout features still love it but oreo kinda ruined it for me also has keyboard lag s7e and moto are interchangeable although i prefer motorola way more than samsung as a phone maker  when or if i get the x it will rank about 3 or 4 it will be my daily driver on tmobile once i cut ties with verizon to save money the iphone se will be the secondary next to it people use multiple phones and platforms i carried 23 phones since 2004 used ios android and windows phone simultaneously in 2011 whats the point of arguing their merits or a picking a side  work  ios home  recreation  android  work  iphone sex travel  iphone x w telephoto  lg v20 w wideangle  close to my smartphone nirvana the iphone x will likely be the last iphone i will buy this decade until samsung galaxy x foldable displays is released
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;i was thinking about just waiting for the successor to the iphone x because it likely adds the fingerprint scanner onto the display but what if face id is amazing already how often is halloween and comiccon anyway just turn it off people just doubting the tech since they never used it similar to how some were doubtful with touch id when 5s introduced it  getting iphone x in 2017 makes more sense to me than 2018 its the 10th year anniversary 2018 iphone x becomes the 11th anniversary that nobody celebrates that x is meant for 10 not 11 what would be cool is an iphone x product red black front and red back the x is the most special edition iphone since the se  haters can keep on hating i dont even like ios and prefer it had launchers to simplify the clutter on that boring static home screen i also dont like using itunes but you cant deny this x will be a success
iPhoneX;MrMobile;urceyes;even at demo the face id didnt work at first and prompted the pass code screen old tech apple as usual and the notch at the top is ridiculous when watching videophoto‚Ä¶
iPhoneX;MrMobile;enriceaux;the only new function on the iphone galaxy s8 is the face scanning and still people want to pay 1000 dollars for this shite i really dont know why apple is still this popular
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dylan Patel;grip impossible suit xzgkrmk nearby produce judgment pay tobacco
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ingus Fridmanis;1k after two years 15k 10s  edit after 1 year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chung Kai Man;will there be a face id for the up coming mac
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lovella Recto;love those new features especially wireless charging camera and ar cant wait for more review on this phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;guylandry1992;i wouldnt buy this phone as theres no way i would spend enough money for a down payment on an average car for a phone and im still not into iphones even though i only use ipads and macs this phone may be late in tech but it is as it seems an improvement on the tech they are finally introducing whatever we may say about old tech and as crazy as i think it may be for the majority of people who will put themselves in debt just for this phone it will work out and people will love them whatever the reason may be it always works out not so well for the customers accounts but it just will the one thing i like is that we are closer to have an entirely bezelfree phone and i know they could have done it but theyll need it so they can make an s s plus and suck more money now im counting on android phone producers to come up with an entirely bezelfree phone within a year one that is all usable screen and even the speaker behind the screen with just a little space for sound
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jo's Gateway;so this video is basically to talk bout all the good things apple didnt do quite well and make them look good so that its 999 price tag could be justified meh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke Janzen;this was better than watching the keynote  you make great videos keep it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pinero91;the swipe feature is from blackberry 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr Shax;a smartphone for dumb people

iPhoneX;MrMobile;NYTOC;wait i have this phone already blackberry z10 blackberry z30 bb passport huh cant wait to piss in peoples faces and show them the phone im carrying is what they have only that it came out five years ago swipe up and theres your home screen hahahaha oh yeah that was the palm  blackberry i am seriously going to love seeing 20 something year olds pull out their new iphones and then look awkwardly at my blackberry oo oh yes ive had this phone for nearly 3 years here put your thumb there and just swipe rightleft or swipe up and voila theres your home screen  no no the pleasure was mine

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Everett Bonds;thanks to samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Adil Riyami;hahahah holy cook ü§£ü§£
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Micha≈Ç Adamczyk;sorry mrmobile but this time youre wrong apart from the fact that true adopting those features by apple will help them reach mass audiences they are not groundbreaking and not even better than other mobile makers features ‚Ä¢ the 60 fps 4k movies and the slomo  fine great but remember you cant stuck sd card into that phone and those movies tend to eat a lot of space and i mean  a lot people with 64 gigs wont be able to shoot many movies with it ‚Ä¢ ar  well erm yeah remember that awesome magic leap movie from about 2 years ago yeah ist still only a demo apart from the fact that its nothing new and innovative tech giants struggle to make use of augmented reality way to often its in your way when it comes to experiencing the world rather than enhancing the experience ‚Ä¢ gestures control  ok you can probably get used to it but is it more convenient better more intuitive very doubtful plus  you will really struggle to use your phone with one hand now ‚Ä¢ wireless charging  well duh ‚Ä¢ and finally  removing the touch id and putting facial recognition apple didnt want to do that its just a workaround because they were unable to place the fingerprint scanner under the screen having that in mind who can say that face recognition is better its not as convenient probably not as safe not as versatile as you will probably have troubles using it in some situations and they couldnt put in the iris scanner because that would be so obvious that they are copying from samsung come on now with all that in mind it is interesting and moving phone but is it really better innovative not really i believe
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ajay raj;considering your pointsvery well laid outbut ar tech is not complete with anybodyand as much as apple showed ar android showed that last yearand with wireless charging i think its a lame thing which is getting promotedits much more inconvenient than usefulemoji thingy is another gimmickif android made it most of the reviewers and users would have called it a gimmickand face id has its own limitationsstill like the iris scanner or the more conventional fingerprint scannernot at the position where samsung placed it its weird
iPhoneX;MrMobile;bensoflyyy;i get you about gestures i used the nokia n9 for half a year before and when i went back to android twas reallyy inconvenient for ne
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Karma Gunz;best vlog on mobile updates good job man enjoy watching your vlogs very neutral and reliable tech info
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ewizzle1978;why the essential above the u11  seems like the design of the u11 has strong design appeal ip67 dual speakers and a top notch camera more to offer imho skin isnt minimal enough
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LokiDaFerret;and it failed at launch apple is just an overpriced android for tards
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ruy Daza Quiroga;save that money waiting a couple of months samsung devices prices always dropiphone x will cost forever 1000 us  pd this high prices tags are insane
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LaidBackFella;mrmobile should have been there
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Madcypher;good points
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;better face scanning isnt a win for everyone michael fisher you read and watch enough scifi to know why this is frightening
iPhoneX;MrMobile;bloodySunday77;i saw all the iphonex introductory videos from the main tech accounts in youtube this is by far the best most wellarticulated factsillustrated wellnarrated and directed and most tothepoint of them all another proof why this guy is just miles ahead big thumbs up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jimmi Pranami;üçé s new multiple charger air play  look like a sanitary pad
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rakesh verma;most comprehensive video on iphone x great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;s10dlka;1 samsung et al introduces a feature 2 it becomes popular 3 apple adopts it and often improves upon it 4 it becomes mainstream  when you view it like that you can see why iphone fans and android fans shouldnt hate each other but be grateful for each other its a symbiotic rivalry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rz_Dragunov;face it people apple not always thee first but they always raise the bar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheTechSultan;so face id will prevent me from unlocking my phone in situations when i cant fully look at it for example when i drive and just want to unlock it while its on the dock to change a song or see a sms noooo i have to remove it look at it when i am driving and then interact with it  face id is cool and great tech but in so many cases its unconvinient  and the price dammm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sultanabran1;doesnt matter what apple does itll sell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;madtrexx;sorry mr mobile but you said so much crap in this video i cant handle it anymore unsub this phone is just lam faceid is lame  it been already tested it works even with a photo so its unsave and uselees ar nobody use it wireless charging nothing gonna change and who cares that apple is popular if ppl have already fe 500mln iphones  they all will not change them now to the x you said a totally bullshit in this video and it was one of the most unobjectiv videos ive seen on this channel slowmo who even use this few skate of surf fans some stupid youtubers slow down and go back to earth
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Terrance Richardson;great video keep up the good work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dorje Gyurme;the cut out at the top of the display and the tall skinny screen are dealbreakers for me the 8 plus‚Äôs 54inch display is smaller diagonally than the iphone x‚Äôs 58inch screen but because it has a¬†wider screen some content will actually look larger on the iphone 678 pluss than on the iphone x for now i will keep my jet black iphone 7plus 256gig and wait for the bezelless iphone xplus with 500 gigs storage

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tony Hedges;a video about the iphone x where the host is able to remain unmoved by applehype well done on being dispassionate without being boring easy for me to say but i appreciate how difficult a balance this is i wonder why you chose to shoehorn in the unnecessary bit about the apple watch it hasnt outwardly changed since it first came out i personally think that it looks awful i prefer my moto 360 2nd gen but thats personal opinion and a touch of classic style well done michael

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sooraj S Hamilpurkar;amazing review the way to explain things are unbeatable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joe S;great video this guy gets it apples software and hardware are implemented so well that it pushes new technologies forward ar and facial recognition will grow at a better and faster rate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;dessnom;not as iumprerssive as sonys 960 fps slomo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WINTERWOLF;apple is like nintendo using old but well known hardware instead of new experimental stuff most experimental stuff are gimmicks  but if experimental stuff gets more well known it can be improved
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MOHAMED ALTEGANI;i was planning to watch the keynote  but thanks to this video  i wont  awosme work mike
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dave Liao;love the optimistic take on the tech in the iphone x itll be good to see more wireless charging pads here and there in the wild
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sanu;1000well fuck you apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nate Adam;out of nowhere im looking into getting my first smartwatch and was wondering does android wear 20 give the option to setup without a smartphone or is the samsung gear s3 a better option
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WHOAITSTHEINTERNET;look im okay with the device its just the buzz around it that always bugs me people giving them credit as if they invented the technology but i will say they do improve tech i just dont think most people know that they use already existing tech
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alejandro Aguilar;new features lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MSi GS70 6QE;oh my god why those usa ppl are so stupid suddenly they started care  bcos iphone has it  god help them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hannu Tuunanen;my s8 is fine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tom Liu;instead of using wireless charging or some new charging tricks how about create a battery that can last at least a week battery is always the weakness of any smartphone without power the 1000 phone is nothing but a piece of junk so how about give user a bigger and battery
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Adam;government hey apple we need everyones fingerprints apple no problemo  government thanks for the fingerprints now lets get those faces that match the fingerprints  apple snm consider it done you government cronies
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike Ivsin;why copy apple vid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DƒÉnu»õ Florian;i came here looking for an honest opinion left disappointed this is just an apple commercial
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shuip Sezairi;so hes not going to mention that the face id failed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GuuzakaTube;i love how he sophisticatedly exposes apple in this video üòÅ i bet he wanted to roast them for claiming to be so firsty about the features but refrained from doing so üòù
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Niroshan Chanaka;you are the best of them all mr  mobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pedro Gomez - Faccio;webos 3
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Stubbo 242;apple should have named this phone the iphone 7s7s and name the iphone x iphone pro im sure apple could have made the phones different by letting the 7s 8 8s utilize software buttons add a back and multi task key also drop the price by 100 dollars on the iphone pro and they would have won over customers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VenVileTV;this is the narrative here competitors clamour to compete with apple butyet these competitors have been releasing so many of these features 23 years ahead of apple tell me something mr mobile in your world tainted by your apple rosetainted glasses is there any possibility that apple may be the ones who feel as though they need to compete with the offerings from their competitors  of course not because its apple right give me a break i understand that youre from the usa and apple is the leading smartphone seller in the us i think but the rest of the world exists and samsung has held that number 1 spot for quite some time now closely followed by huawei guess what the rest of the world doesnt revolve around apple  maybe if you tech journalists took a minute to consider that thered be a bit more neutrality and balance of praise in this industry apple can do no wrong and even when theyre the last to do anything they might as well be the first to me something is wrong with that type of thinking and behaviour
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VenVileTV;why arent there any popular tech journalist brave enough to call it like it is and say that compared to what the competition is offering the iphone x is shitoverpriced shit  stop giving this company a pass for their mediocre latetothedance implementations theyre always 23 years behind and they get praised for it why because they do it the best no the only thing theyre doing great here is the faceid by their claims every single other thing theyve done has come late and is just as good as what the competition offers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jerad Berry;apples the most famous plagiarist but anyway good im glad apples actually bringing it this year maybe samsung will actually start trying again with their next note and galaxy again
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khang Tran;sony 960fps fyi
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Brad Hall;apple pisses me off
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vishnu Prasad;i think ar is shit everything else i agree with michael fisher
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SharkBait Ooh Ha Ha;why would anyone want that 1000 piece of trash im waiting on the lg v30 way better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Xalataf;iphone x copies everything and removes headphone jack and puts high price iphone xi 1440p display when others have 4k and no charger iphone xii no cameras and kiddy crap   yet people freaking buy this pile of turd edit i may buy it for the 4k60fps camera
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Riccardo Spiazzi;incredibly well done video finally an analysis worth watching keep going
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jiujitsujedi;always giving apple a hall pass pathetic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yasuke;of course youre clamoring all over this
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ffs stop blazing;as a galaxy s8 user i can say that im pretty impressed with the iphone x the only real downside is the design on the front side it just looks disgusting imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ThatGreekGeek;blackberry 10s gesture control is the best
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bboy Jeans;i also listen to stuff you should know
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Chris;a 1000 phone without headphone jack without fingerprint scanner without home button and yeah they switch to oled screen which was already available for several years ill stick to any flagship phone so long as its android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hambert;no gesture interface has been the same as the one in the nokia n9 truly legendary
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hardeep Singh;mr mobile please make a video about dbrand i have no idea what is dbrand

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aizen sama;1319 cad fuck that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;now you can swipe up to unlock your iphone thanks its not like stock android had that since lollipop in 2014
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike M;charging over wifi connection would be better to be able to use device while charging at same time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mike M;iphones are just pure junk the 8 and 8 plus basically same old boring plain iphones the x is just pure copy of the essential phone apple still continuing to struggle to innovate of any of their own ideas and still cant catch up to other big brands
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;i beg to differ its not betting anything on its success apple gets a pass for everything it fails at so it doesnt matter as always everybody else gets held accountable even for things that work but not 110 perfection thats the sad world we live in when brands have such a cult level status
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;palm webos httpstechcrunchcom20170913theiphonexrevealswhytimcookwassomadaboutpalm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aldo S;youre the only one i can watch without tapping the screen to see how much time is left amazing reviews
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abcdefg;ive had more features on android for so many yearswhy do people keep buying iphones im assuming caus of the processor caus i dont see any other reason to get one although i admit i have had a couple they were big letdowns after having android phones i guess kudos to apple for brainwashing so many people
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hanung Ramadhana;jony idiotic ive is really make a mess with apple

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moneybag James;yeaa didnt it fail to unlock on its debut
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jonathan Oren;i love your review so much more than the phone i do like the phone but your review amazing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;.NetSam;the gesture controls are exactly the same as those in blackberry 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sitou Dien;its a great time to rob some iphone users ¬†kidding aside ar emojis and even better camera and screen ¬†apple has failed ¬†rehashed features ¬†how is emojis going to make our lives better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Coniac Marius;no matter how good is the new iphone x if the software is rubish and the phone requires itunes for a simple operation of copy files to it from a computer
iPhoneX;MrMobile;AkoTo Marjon;face id did not work duting demo lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tru ville;did we watch the same  face id fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tru ville;just like they improved  touch id ooops google pixel took that lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sarcasm_;apple shouldve gave an option with the fingerprint scanner on the back im gonna look so damn dumb if apple pay messes up at the register ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Noice McNoiceFace;1000 for a talking shit emoji no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JAGADISH BHATTA;4k60 is something new also hevc support except these all others features are meh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Masroor Raza;wallpaper in samsung mobile at 0150 anyone please
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ray Claustro;love the music total thumbs up iphone x is gonna take a lot of rethinking and rethinking to see if its worth losing old reliable 7 plus for great review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheCompassMaker;ive been wallowing in the antiapple circlejerk for a time that this reasonable take on the launch is quite refreshing the only thing though is on that face id tech they say that they poured research time and money but that remains to be seen i think siri was the last such apple endeavor but that took some work to become well refined
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harry Cordero Aviles;the most neutral video i have seen
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JayDeePLUS BEATZ;üçé üöÆüöÆ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;David Den;plz plz plz plz plz michael review the cat s41 phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;donky dunky;take my kidney and give me iphone x please
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WitnessG;im sure the faceid thing works pretty fast and reliably but theres no way its going to be better than a fingerprint sensor you can unlock the phone with a fingerprint sensor while youre still picking it up with the faceid you have to put it directly infront of you at the right angle to get your entire face most of the time when im using my phone its not facing parallel to my face its usually angled back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dmitriy Chaikovskiy;so pretty much iphone has nothing new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Cohen;listen to your sign off then do it again one more time dont want to kill yourself turn it up a lil how bout now ahhh there we go
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke Toepfer;i like that apple has now included wireless charging it will make wireless more popular  thus making it even better for android people who like wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vishal Bhoir;without being in the eventyou described astonishingly well than others kudos to your style michaelüëåüèº
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ahmad Sufi;with 1000 i can buy ‚úì oneplus 5  ‚úìsamsung gear s3 frontier¬† ‚úì amazon fire tablet 8 hd display 32 gb  ‚úì big mac  meal with extra cheeseüòé

iPhoneX;MrMobile;nasilemak ayamsedap;its an outdated features for sure people still buy it for no reason
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cristobal C Torres;im pretty sure that face id will increase car accidents
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tomwiles;when you take a screenshot is the result perfectly rectangular or does it have those funny ears on the top edge with the selfie camera bezel cutout blank displayed in the screenshot
iPhoneX;MrMobile;PALEO;this is iphone x not iphone ten
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pixypolly;1149 for the shit i can already do with my android smartphone no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;piratesmvp;i cant believe that they were okay with a camera bump on the back im pretty sure steve jobs would never have liked that also face id takes too long to unlock the phone if they want people to start using that instead of a passcode it needs to be nearly instantaneous finally what if youre using your phone on the table and need to unlock it before you could use touch id to unlock now you will have to either use the passcode or pick up the phone to look at it and then set it down again i recommend waiting for the iphone xs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alva Williams;apple is smart loool first they got your fingerprint and now theyre scanning your whole face thanks for giving them more information
iPhoneX;MrMobile;CHIGOZIE ATUEGBU;i wish i had enough money to order this iphone 10üò¢
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mikldude;it looks quiet good  but  its still an iphone ü§î
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MotoKoko;id love to buy it but its 1150 soo

iPhoneX;MrMobile;NeoDerGrosse;you forgot the most important stolen feature ditching the 9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bugdroid;oh god in 2018 oems will start removing fingerprint scanner god help us
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dwizzle jay;when i watch the event it was like watching sony samsung and lg talk about there new gee wiz of a phone i saw nothing new at allsmh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ¥Ÿáÿ®ŸàÿØŸäŸÜ;that photo id and 3d is the most scariest for the year of 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wrathchicken;no thoughts1st impressions on animoji
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Gerrard;i know that you dont want to bash apple it is easy to do but really they are doing poorly their phones are way too expensive for what you get it seems like they remove features but increase the price at the same time no finger print scanner no headphone jack  please pay more i know apple help to push google and others but still they dont deserve the position they hold
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LouisvandeWetering;where is the headphone jack where can i put a memory card no way i am going to pay ‚Ç¨1000 for a phone without these features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;conlee22;this was a weird video usually you wait until you get to have your hands on a product before saying how good it is    and since weve already seen the face id fail and alot of other things have been done in other phones you seem like youre promoting the iphone x in this video just my thoughts not much sceptisism as there normally would be for a device thats yet to be used
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ganjabobby;this is the first iphone x video ive watched normally its always mkbhds first impressions video thats pops up in my suggestions  i just go with it but these days i really want to hear what mr mobile thinks about the latest tech release
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kevin H.;now that it has wireless charging expect the next iphone to not have a charging port
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Will Aird;at 335 on the note 8 where did you find that wallpaper
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;gestures are good for some actions on a phone but that app switching gesture they are using looks like it could get painful quickly  the faceid stuff is neat and all but that it failed at first during its first demo seems quite slow and has a floodlight which is nice but has very limited uses people unlock their phones when they arent putting them right in front of their faces which are all offputting things about it  lets face it they doubled down on faceid when it became clear that a beneathdisplay fingerprint reader was not going to happen with oled displays in time for the launch
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke et;ios 11 literally web os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qeryhii Dgusz;fail face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nerch Fritzsche;do the front cameras recognise depth what if you put a photo with the owners face will it unlock the phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anthony Hernandez;the note 8 is still better ¬†so the final is that the iphone x has barely caught up to samsung galaxy ¬†the display is the same as the note 4wow ¬†everything has been done ¬†so guess what the note 8 at 50 off which is better than the iphone x which will never have a discount
iPhoneX;MrMobile;w3apon3;you are so right about palm webos was the best os and years ahead of its time i sold my iphone 3g s cancelled my att contract and signed up with sprint to get that phone the financial troubles of palm and the exclusivity of sprint doomed the phone and os but like you said companies keep borrowing features to implement in their oss
iPhoneX;MrMobile;–ê–±—Ä–∞—Ö–∞–º;gotta love your honesty
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tinas Askus;ios 11 in samsung shell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tipoomaster;it may be the smallest lte smartwatch but three generations not extending that oled to edge to edge ehh the bezel looks dated with all the bezel shrinking going on in the rest of apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rokas Anonimas;this video should be called overpraising iphone x besides the 240 fps 1080p videos i did not see anything really interesting from iphone x it is a really good device but it is nothing special
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jonathan Pena;thanks for bringing the old memories of our forgotten palm webos software which was the best mobile os ever with its card and gestures
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tipoomaster;something about the combination of the oled screen in the demo area and the launchpad homescreen grid made the latter seem particularly dated idk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jorge Alicio Kaida;you wear lg warch sport everyday review please
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Som Harsh;durand people are crazy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TechSesh;really great video you really are mrmobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kramdens1967;with a fingerprint sensor my phone is unlocked before i even barely have it out of my pocket i think if everyone starts getting rid of those its a loselose not a winwin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;afromarco005;someone care to explain why apple is still relevant in late 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cyle Hendricks;one thing you all forget usually when apple does something they do it right facial scanner that has a one in a million chances of being fooled a fingerprint scanner that actually works their cameras back in the day were always 1 imessage  android has yet to develop something on par with it the apple watch can‚Äôt be matched by any other smart watch  that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 1 don‚Äôt get me wrong i‚Äôm not an apple sheep well maybe a little i do have a note8 which i love but since most people i know and family use iphone it makes the overall experience even more important
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar M.;best video that describes why what apple is doing is with iphone x is important kudos subscribed for this awesome insight
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Omar nieves;loving my fast wireless charging on note 8 enjoy your new revolutionary regular fast charging apple suck a dik
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Melvin Ray Spence III;does it still make calls ls it still a phone who the hell needs all these features this is the 10 year anniversary phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;poeglives;so face id is going to work better than it did at the event
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hussam El-khawaga;what about comparing the price with the new functions  features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lucas Borges;ho ho ho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;James Russo;are gestures faster than using a home key of some sort i dont think so in the same way that face unlock is slower than a fingerprint scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anas Safa;seriously bro how much did they pay for you to break the contract
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sebastian J;iphone x is not 10even tho x is the roman numeral for 10u shant skip 9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DavidFR;sidncifhfbcicifjrncciswowowsndidhrddij geekgasm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rishi Pahwa;fantastically shot review mr mobile such a joy to watch your review vids
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cory Wilson;the only thing new about phone is the price android already had these features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Oscar Maradiaga;love how you said they arent the 1st to do many things we all know apple is always catching up to android and the reason many youtubers like yourself are on the latest android devices
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bryan S;mr mobile highlights exactly why apple has been so wack these past few years they dont innovate anymore as stated in the intro they take things that have been invented and applied in elsewhere and they make them better its as if they wait around for other companies to invent something or to come up with some clever software and then apples rd says how can we make it better how can we adapt it to the iphone theyre playing catchup now the iphone x is a beautifully designed phone but ios is still as boring as ever
iPhoneX;MrMobile;le iboy;how are you supposed to use ur phone when wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andy Rackley;its irrelevant what hardware apple brings the phone can still not be customized and looks absolutely the same as the original iphone its boring  michael did a great job with the review but as a note 8 user of one week now no way i would give it up for an iphone 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gustavo S√°enz;can someone tell me what are the differences between iphone 7 and 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SaNu BaiJulal;i love your videos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr2pint;apple increased the price of the ipad pro line straight after this event  go figure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;weedwak;replacing fingerprint with faceid was unbelievably stupid i mean google already tried it in 2011 and i use it on my phone today for when my phone is on a table or something and it didnt take off fingerprints are simply more convenient  i just hope other manufacturers dont follow this absolutely braindead stupid idea
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Twunk;i already found spending 600dollars on a phone too much 1 thousand dollars though come on peopleit‚Äôs not even available in rose gold anymorei‚Äôm sticking with my se
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VERSATILE KNOWLEDGE;next iphone is iphone k  k stands for your kidney  u need to sell it to buy it üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gareth Harris;great video mate quality of your content keeps getting better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fahad Abdul Samad;you forgot to mention about excellent nokia n9 which came with 100 gesture control had nokia stick to mego and develop it furthermay be things would have been different
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Naveen Raj;now after this launch i am really looking forward to the changes in  pixel next year will google be able to bring in a breakthrough mobile next year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ahmad Debian;ok two mores phone to go ¬†the pixel xl 2 and huawei mate 10 and i will be able to decide which phone will be the successor for my note 5so far my top choices are the¬†lg v30 and¬†htc u 11
iPhoneX;MrMobile;VeroMithril;now who steal your phone also steal your face
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Markec smotanec;i dont use iphone because i love android but i phone is the best when they relased somethinglike face idit will work 100  samsung not sowhen they do tech  they do it right that is apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wilson ndebay;the black bar should have gone through the top two ends but staying in the middle while the screen surrounds it is almost a distraction to me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mick Delaney;michael how can you call face id a win regardless when it failed to work during apples life unveiling of the phone fact is it will be gimmicky and will not work as consistantly or as accurately as a fingerprint scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Debra Dukes;absolutely gorgeous devices debüëç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cesar Alvarez;iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jimmy Song;i feel like apple ditched touch id because they want to cut the production cost i find it being really cheap on their part because theyre charging 10001100 but who knows they might bring it back with iphone xs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GamingLaw;innovation based old patents
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raveen Bikha;well its old features that exist on android but now the competition getting harder android get better optimization and ios more features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Scott M;what about when i want¬† to checklook at¬†my phone but not unlock it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A. B;hey apple fans how feels the samsung displays and full screen and samsung chip welcome to the club
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gguybr;dont that brow at the top disturb any of you especially  on video playing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NickL Leeto;excellent video michael thumbs up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;face id didnt even work at the presentationwhy not have iris scanning
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;whats the battery capacity on the iphone 10 2 hours longer than the iphone 7 what about iphone 8 and 8plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;is samsung supplying the oled displays for apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;where is the x pen
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TimDawg 919;apple remember the last company that decided to skip a model number note 7 no note 6 so you decide to jump over 9 and do x get out your fire extinguishers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sir Ivn;where is multi window
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bla≈æ Veber;two years too late remove the charging port that will be the first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Peter Armijo;1000 dollars still stuck on 3gb ram still stuck on a resolution of 2436√ó1125 thats bull shit nothing new here and no micro sd slot wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TimDawg 919;iphone x the x is for expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;321bluff;you are a samsung hater iam not surprised with the video
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hamaid Ahmed;i like the caption of the video new effin phone old features apples best recipe to feed its sheeple good vid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BattleExtremeNL;for that price i can buy 1 oneplus 5 1 nokia 3310 1 console  game and still have some change  this phone better whipe my ass and call me daddy for that price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;they put wireless charging so that they could ditch the lightning port next year so that you will have to use air pods or any other wireless headphones bastards i know they will do this if not in 2018 they will do it 2019 this is not an innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fabio Rigo;number 1 gestures  for real  thats the new thing   this is mr mobile channel right  video highly disappointing i wanted some meaningful insight not the second part of the apple marketing campaign  but do not fret everybody is uncritically gushing as you do you are in good company
iPhoneX;MrMobile;wascar G;damn am another video that i should not started watching because i cant stop watching once i start watching mr mobile doing reviews  introduction to a movie sort of a good one thats what it feels
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anand Ks;apple does things better instead of doing it first simple they are not good enough to things first they always want to copy and be more perfect with older things  mrmobile  you have been one reviewer ive always been waiting for thanks the honest review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ezeuzo1;you have slightly changed my perspective on the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tech Majid;no apple ditch touch id because of no space where they apply
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;iphone xs gesture controls is the single most underrated feature nobody is talking about except for the best tech reviewer ever mr mobile its webos reincarnated swipe up to close apps and carousel üé† to the next ones will feel awesome  toss in the fact that ios11 with drag  drop and file manager will be a bigger update for ios than oreo has been for android users i have oreo on my pixel and i barely notice any differences from nougat it feels a little worse for me  apple decided to use qii open standard charging benefits everyone including ones with android especially if you are hanging out at starbucks no proprietary bullshit it may not be the prettiest iphone ever and its xpensive but it still is the best iphone  ios update ever
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sean Turner;the palm pre was so ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anas Nazeer;so revolutionary im all wet down there revolutionary in stealing and copying and calling it theirs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Lindsay;the 60 fps is really cool but by ditching the touch id they really better make sure face id is flawless and judging by yesterdays applefest its far from it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kris S.;long live webos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Inajet Dzemoski;excellent review my friend classy as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Da Fuq;where is the iphone 9 lol apple pulled a m on us
iPhoneX;MrMobile;soulreplenished;definitely disagree with the idea that gestures are a good replacement for the home button specifically the fingerprint sensor to preserve the security value of the fingerprint sensor you have to make sure your face has to be within the cameras frame of view i can unlock my secured phone straight from my pocket just by pulling my out phone whilst my thumb is on the fingerprint home button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;zohaib javed;great review the best i ve seen yet
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Takuma Kawai;hey michael i completely agree with you about your opinion for the iphone x i have been an android user for all this time but still the iphone x seems so interesting and just cant wait to get my hands on it didnt show up on the video but one of my most curious technology in the new iphones is the auto wb thank you for your great videos and ill be looking forward for more peace
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Studio Glass Box;my car has qi wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tri spin;tyr
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Julian Summers;ill get the watch and maybe the 8but i aint paying no thousand dollars for one thingwhen that same thousand can bring 2 things economics my niggas
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nemo Lee;most new things are just gimmicks and for the other things we should say at the end it came to an iphone and that for such an heffty price no apple thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Zachary Batten;i think its funny how people say the faceid mess up was an actual mess up you have to enter your pass code once you turn on your device thats all that happened faceid did not fail i was sad they didnt mention that after it happened
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;if apple never named their iphones with an s and numbered it like air jordan shoes every year the iphone x would have been released last year now after releasing 14 different iphone models its confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9  this is what apple should have done without s naming  2007  iphone 2008  iphone ii instead of 3g 2009  iphone iii instead of 3gs 2010  iphone iv 2011  iphone v instead of 4s 2012  iphone vi instead of 5 2013  iphone vii instead of 5s 2014  iphone viii instead of 6 2015  iphone ix instead of 6s 2016  iphone x instead of 7 2017  iphone xi instead of 8  x  only the first iphone and iphone 4 were named properly poor iphone 9 and 7 doesnt get an s model next year remove the numerics and refer to it only as iphone the same way the numerics no longer exist for ipads or a macbook
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Saso Stoilevski;ok who can tell me how many times did they mention the word revolutionary on the presentation   if i heard that word from any company that many times i would start thinking that they made something worth listening jesus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Black Knight;a thousand us dollars i dont care how much time and money went into all those features they build the the thing for less than 300 theyll make back whatever they spent on rd and much more profit if they sell it for 700 which is already a super premium flagship price the things you can get for a thousand us dollars
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spencer Crawley Jr;man oh man do i miss webos im with you mrmobile sentimental or not it did things that just worked that ios and android are still figuring out alas the show must go on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert McCarty;what a piece of shit apple really screwed over their design hahathe camera is all lg they even asked lg to help them  infinity display really haha so pathetic the s8 and g6 both have infinity displays and both are alot better apple has that dip on the top of the phone that causes the screen to be out of place thats one ugly screengive me a break what utter trash apple has become
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charles Lang;thank you for the information as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lachemiz;webos was all right from the start
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rashad Jones;306 i bet arya could fool it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozzy Mendoza;ps mr mobile sounds like he got a fat check from apple or he just likes being a hype man
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozzy Mendoza;honestly pretty disappointed with this iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeppe Werring;i just wish apple would improve notifications and notification center they are just awful notifications and the notification slider on android is amazing one of my favorite things about android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;to me the iphone 7 plus jet black is more beautiful than the new models
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Domenico Lamberti;eurgh goddamnit webos was so damn good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Clifton Honaker;another fantastic video i give you props and admire how fast you put this video together professionalism and its very well put together on your presentation big fan and keep up the good work your videos are the best on the web my take on the iphone x i cringe on the slight innovation following xiaomi samsung and blackberry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;largg3;web os still rocks  and i still hate hp for killing it 1 if you agree
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alfredo Garcia;mr mobile you are getting better and better with time your narrative style and choice of words your use of images and flow of story telling is the reason i keep coming back to you when it comes to technology reporting thank you and keep up the great work ag
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hanif Muhammad;eargasm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jerry zhang;i love web osits real cool and convenienceif today have web os on the phone and have many apps that will be more great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jake Seegs;seeing all these palm pre references made me yearn for webos that was my first smart phone it was truly ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hideika;youre one of the best tech youtubers out there i love how your views are very unbiased unlike most youtubers out there
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ajproc06;there are 3 reasons why i wont be buying the iphone 10 or the iphone 8 first im shocked they didnt call the 8 the 7s first two has to with ios with android i can have show box on my phone and also with android i have a hacked app that gives me pandora one for free so i cant use ios as the os on my cellphone for that reason now i can use ios on a tablet witch its fine since i do like ios now last reason why i wont be buying the iphone 10 or 8 is the price like really like no cellphone should cost you 1000 even 700 for the 8 is still way to high yes i know samsung with there s8 and note 8 are charging about the same price but be real no phone should cost that much i say charge no more then 500 for cellphones and most people if they want it bad enough will have to take out a loan to buy it like this if i had the money i would have bought the unlocked blackberry keyone thats the most anyone should be charging for a phone so apple and samsung and lg and anyone who makes phones and may read this lower your damn prices on your phone they are way to fucking high
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ethan Davis;does it have usbc yet
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TECH IN 5;micheal youre too good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Henfrey;i must admit i dont customise as much as i used to with my android but ios is still too restricting when it comes to ui being forced to use apples apps for certain features and customisation to a point where i dont want to touch it  however i have to give them credit for using qi for wireless charging and with the apple tv selling 4k movies at the same price as 1080 and doing a free upgrade to 4k  that in itself is tempting me down the apple route for my filmtv content
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GAMETEX;apple skipped a number and what will happen now samsung skipped 6 and note 7 went blowing upso lets see
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Josef 03;man that black note 7 is so fing beautiful üò≠üò≠üò≠
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;im sure apples implementation of face id will be astronomically better than samsungs or microsofts  but it doesnt matter because its a bad solution to a problem that doesnt need to exist fast fingerprint readers are better in every way you can unlock the phone while taking it out of your pocket you can do it without looking at the phone you can authenticate nfc payments in one movement  so why get rid of touch id because it was on the home button and apple for some absurd reason doesnt want to move the sensor to the back like most other phone manufacturers have done they even have the perfect spot for it in their industrial design ie the damn apple logo rear fingerprint scanners when properly placed unlike the lastminute kludge in the s8 line are ergonomically superior to frontfacing underthedisplay home buttons because you dont need to adjust your grip to use them  this is no physical right click all over again apple would rather sell overengineered junk like the mighty mouse than admit someone else came up with a better design theyd rather users of 55 iphones employ the kludge of reachability to reach ioss legacy topleft back buttons designed for a 35 screen than admit android was more forwardlooking by placing the software back button on the bottom left  and theyd rather replace touch id with this technologically impressive kludge than admit lg came up with a better solution several years ago  the nerve of tim cook calling this illconceived and overpriced product a revolution on the scope of the original iphone is more impressive than the device itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SystemRichie;the iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harrybo;i gotta admit i dont like apple as a company pricing the same or higher price than competitors for less features but theyve done some good things with the x and i look forward to the popularisation of wireless charging over anything i wont buy the iphone x but i congratulate them for this and thank them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Didier Hernandez;i too get nostalgic about webos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Colorified;very clean intro
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jack Johnson;soooo 1000 for a harder way to go home go into multitasking and go into a control center plus a worse way to unlock your phone   so once the honeymoon period is over you basically are spending 300 plus more dollars for a less intuitive way to do things  just because a car replaces its wheels for super high tech electromagnetic rails doesnt mean the rails are better to use day to day   and the iphone 8 is just a 7s pretty much  i actually thought apple did pretty well last year with the 7 and 7 but this is really bad imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nizar El-Zarif;looks great but cant justify the one grand price for the entry model my lg g6  2 years contract which includes unlimted callingtexting adn 2gb data still cost less
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ender;this phone looks great honestly the iphone 7 looked shit to me this actually looks new the price though i horrible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;CAMPING DOESN'T PAY!;lol love your reviews so refreshing and smart
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nat Chea;the guys at samsung are probably chucklingüòÅüòÅüòÅ over the new iphones right now they might have been nervous over what apple might do this year but after seeing this theyre probably twerking throwing confetti in the air and popping champagne bottles saying guys guys its okay theres no competition here but people will buy iphones regardless lolsss smh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ubeydullah Yilmaz;my old samsung galaxy s3 had even face id scan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;even as good as face id is thats no excuse to ditch touch id because some people will still find it convenient i hate apples bullshit approach of choosing only one thing that it thinks is the best and eliminating all the rest instead of giving people the benefit of versatility thats why the s8 is so cool is because i have an iris scanner if i like that face id like approach and then a fingerprint scanner that works in conjunction for added convenience and adaptability in more situations
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SojoriTechnology [Kamruzzaman];it was amazing video keep it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SuperNovaHeights;the iphone x is the greatest phone of all time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sandesh M√≠√±√∞ Fre√¢k Sawant;apple   new iphones are the first smartphones designed for augmented reality  android  lenovo phab pro 2  zenrone ar  apple lies blatently isheeps will believe it anyway üòÇüòÇ

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Swissguy;we have iphone x to give please subscribe to our channel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;OLBastholm;i really expected a lot of webos talk in this video not disappointed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;still has smaller screen to body ratio than note 8 81 percent vs 83 i also rounded both thats so sad they made such a big deal about the bezelless design and still couldnt make it have small side bezel if u want true bezelless design with 90 percent or above screen to body you need a no mix
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Duncan F.;this is the first iphone i could consider getting since my 3gs back in the day  prior to my iphone i used symbian after ive used android and love it  but nothing can steal me away from all my apps android smartwatch and the like
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dario Hall;im not an apple fan but i love the competition the cellphone market has as phones get better and better budget and low cost phones get really good for a fraction of the price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nicolas Raney;i will admit i wasnt too taken with the new gesture interface granted i can see why you like it and i could definitely see myself adapting just like you described but i just dont think its obvious enough for consumers i mean i know some mostly old people who still dont know how multitasking works on their old phones adding on two swipes from the bottom for fundamental actions that you do all the time as well as specific pulldown gestures that dont even have a little helpful software indicator like the bar on the bottom to indicate that theyre there and i just think that the average consumer would be more confused than relieved at the changes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Redowan Nafi;the phone looks extremely ugly with the cutout and the ugly ios icons v30 and note 8 still look better but holy crap that monster of an soc better camera ar technology and the face recogniton is a step towards the right direction
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Deividas Skeberis;what i like 1 4k 60 fps video 2 cameras what i hate 1 ios 2 no fingerprint sensor 3 no headphone jack 4 ugly looking bezel 5 price i think if youre an iphone user you should get iphone 8 this one is just too expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;itsbiju;the iphone 8 is probably going to be the least sold iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;skelleytor;what i want is a shatterproof screenid be nice not having it in a clunky case all of its life span
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harpreet06;wireless charging is great ive got it in my car and its in mcdonalds too i dont think its that rare faceid is a gimmick takes longer than fingerprint to unlock even if they remove the swipe up then everytime you check the time itll unlock
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emanuel Sirbu;i wasnt an apple fan but this time the iphone x really got my attention im already saving money to buy it d
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nir Kopp;apple did good this year i admit but im sick of apple been so popular for no reason that have stopped being innovative and start using features of others
iPhoneX;MrMobile;drees84;control center is now up top that actually annoys me a lot having it at the bottom made the ios more onehand friendly now it was forced to the top to make room for the new home bar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;THANK YOU;to compare products  prices etchttpwwwqoo10sggalleryq108030459
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Frazier;i was very excited about the announcement i am a selfproclaimed phonebigamist cough captain twophones cough but i think my overall disappointment stems from four things 1 overly high expectations i dont know what i was expecting to see most everything that was shown certainly met all expectations due to the incredibly prolific and accurate leaks but i left feeling somewhat underwhelmed by it all once i saw that the emperor had no clothes i couldnt not see the overthetop marketing speak and hype for what it was 2 the iphone 8 line while unarguably superior to the 7 doesnt hold a candle to the x the smaller chassis the nearly bezelfree oled screen the lack of chin and forehead and the improved cameras on the x make the 8 the phone that the otherguy buys i fully admit i buy some phones not only for the function and form but for bragging rights im not proud of that fact i just recognize that its a powerful motivator for my next phone purchase 3 the x delivers in november while thats not at all a big deal to some im impatient again im not proud of that aspect of my personality but there it is i want it now and hyping it up and making me wait makes me feel well disappointed 4 the geewhizgoshthatscool features they were hyping as revolutionary faceid edgetoedge screen faceunlock and animojis either already exist in my galaxy s8 or are at least for my demographic just plain silly i mean sure  the talking chicken thing was funny and cute but am i really going to use it maybe once or twice but its not likely going to be part of my daily usagepattern the relighting effect in portraitmode doesnt honestly look any better than what snapseed can do am i just too old and crotchety for this phone maybe id even say probably but even though im docking myself points for being impatient and using my techdevice as a statussymbol rather than a tool im going to give myself a few points back for resisting the latest in gadgetlust

iPhoneX;MrMobile;kaala jadu;iphone x vs note 8 camera  iphone wins software android wins fingerprint scanner samsung wins screen  equal processor apple wins extras spen headphone jack samsung     stereo speakers  apple so samsung wins final verdict nobody cares get what you like but note 8 wins
iPhoneX;MrMobile;AchillesNYC;the game demos were actually not that compelling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fishkeeper63;i think itll probably be an amazing phone but its still nowhere near worth the money especially here in the uk where theyre selling it for the equivalent of 1330

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mititelu Radu;i love the apple is betting its reputation  what reputation  the reputation that they offer less then ever before for more ever before the reputation that is milking people for money the reputation that if you have an apple product ppl will look at you like you are retarded because you have 1300euros phone 2000 plus euro laptop and you have to have a bag with cables with you the reputation that their own products dont fucking work outside basic jobs because are incompatible with everything on the planet including other apple products this is the reputation that they are betting sorry to say but is not really that much today my friend who have an iphone 7 plus got hers macbook and she had to use my old htc m8 to setup the laptop because there was no way an iphone with mobile data connection will speak with and macbook to share a data connection 3000euros in technology that is shit in real life use again this is the reputation that apple is betting

iPhoneX;MrMobile;tauhid ahmed;i like unicorns
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Just Doin' Life;i appreciate this guy souch for calling apple out but with class they literally take old technology and put their logo on it and then it becomes exciting to the rest of the world its shady however its genius in keeping the company relevant while riding the success of they name they built in 20072010 i will never spend my money on an apple product but im definitely enjoying the climb of their stock because i know for sure that millions of unconscious consumers will clamours for this old phone in new clothing ü§£üòÇüòàüí∞
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MiLoHWD1983;the iphone x is not waterproof tsk tsk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;madsdgdhg;how did they tough that having that notch on top ruining the design and the full immersive screen experience was a good ideia its horrible look at the samsung s8 or even better the lg v30 thats how its properly done they could even put a front facing speaker in thw bottom and why removing the fingerprint reader why not simply make the apple symbol on the back a finger print reader yes they cant innovate anymore
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SARSX452;i phone xpensive thats what the x stands for

iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;im not so sure about the legal implications of face id i mean what if it has a racial bias problem apple doesnt really have a diverse workforce also toowhat if something happens to your face and you cant unlock the phone why couldnt apple just turn that nice apple logo into a rear mounted fingerprint sensor

iPhoneX;MrMobile;CrayDude345 // RageEX;apple can sorta fuck off  i say sorta because they can still improve
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sean Murdock;so i guess ar is not a gimmick right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;dat boi;iphone x makes iphone 8 outdated and iphone 8 design is way too similar or same as last year design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;York Town;ios 11   a11 bionic chip is just fucking overkill
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rohan Charlesworth;id only call the face id a win if the device supported touch id as well still i have used windows hello with my surface book since launch and it does work well so i have no thought that the face id will not work the issue arises that if i wanna pay for a coffee etc taking my pixel out and resting my finger on the back of the phone whilst i lift it out of my pocket is just miles more intuitive then getting my phone a look at my face in the middle of a queue etc just seems apple being awkward again for the sake of it they easily could have fit a touch sensor on the rear of the phone but then they would have to move the branding which a form over function company like apple wouldnt

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Henning Gu;i‚Äôm excited for the future of wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrKodanNche;i still think the lg v30 is more beautiful than the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Azcoon21centuryworks;wow i always hated apple but this is a really really good phone i actually like it almost even more then the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Awayze;happy with my i7 at ¬£1000 ill wait a few months before picking it up as no doubt itll be the best phone out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eir Apps;no way face id is ever going to be as reliable and convenient as touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;watch iphone users act like face unlock is new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M & H;the apple just jumped to the iphone 10 to get more money from yours
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M & H;the iphones 8 and 8 plus still the same shit but only the iphone x is better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mutio86;lets be honest apple failed in putting touch id under the display and try to market face id as the next big thing which it isnt also when i got my phone next to me on my table i wanna unlock it like that not having to pick it up or hover my face over it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ry Estares;the thing is no manufacturer released something new this year manufacturers only made screens bigger batteries bigger more megapixels etc no one released a new technology that will make our lives easier
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ponchi;if there are twins that hate each other and one stays in a room and another stays in their mothers and faps the the twin unlocks his phone and looks at the search history im not getting iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Willie Blanchard;this is a good phone but its nothing innovative this phone is everything a a bit less that the essential and s8 plus is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ponchi;what i hate about face id is when you picture someone and show the face on his phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Willie Blanchard;the face recognition doesnt work if your eyes are closed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mutio86;i dont want some swipe bs i want a home button also reachability i use that all the time and on a tall 58 screen considering to switch to android waiting for the pixel 2
iPhoneX;MrMobile;FSR;conclusion the best thing about apple is       other phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;zulchemical;just waiting for the s9 with hopefully finger print scanner on the screen

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nerdology;let me guess android oems are gonna start removing fingerprint sensors from their phones and only use face id from now on just like they did with the whole headphone jack because apparently apple is innovative and is ahead of everyone else when it comes to inconvenience

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mark Robby;mr cook say that it was a horror of a life time cos iphone is getting retarded and that this is what they could managed to offers in a market runs by samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mark Robby;dinasaur  i will see if you all would complain about the price of this crap the way youve been doing about the note 8 the great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Â≤©Êú¨ÊñáÈõÑ;where is iphone 8 and 9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;i dont think face id is going to be all that great specially when it comes to apple pay this is what i hate other companies do these features that the new iphone has for years and suddenly when apple do it oh they do it better and i disagree
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;i disagree with the wirless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryan Collins;yeah but apples not going to do wirless charging any better as its not going to be fast wirless charging and will be looking at 3545 hours for a charge
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;apple adopting qi is surprising and nudges some respect from me  first since the apple macintosh ii
iPhoneX;MrMobile;visionpersistance;people seem to forget that jon rubinstein who was among the many next inc personnel who arrived at apple along with steve jobs when he returned in 1997 and was appointed the first senior vice president of hardware by jobs during the 20 era and a lot of the palm pre hardware and software team originally worked on the purple project or the original iphone before being hired by palm so its not surprising the pre was the only other device worthy of comparison with and arguably superior in many aspects to the original iphone

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ionut Daniel Serban;i¬¥m not usually praising youtubers but manyou are on the next level good content on point original not too geeky but not too shallow sound and video quality are not excentric but they¬¥re not bad or just good either and the most unbiased point of view from youtube smartphone panorama pretty sure you could even do good movies  really flowless work as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hosni Guiling;iphone 8  meh iphone x  üòç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ITX Official;as an android user i was quite impressed with yesterdays keynote and really enjoyed watching the presentation of the iphone x apple finally caught up with todays standards and managed to produce a phone that ticks almost all 2017 smartphone trend boxes theres one thing i highly disagree with you though you said that wireless charging wasnt really a thing until now and that it will be way more popular with apple jumping on the bandwagon i dont know about the situation in the us but here in austria and also germany wireless charging gained a huge following since the introduction of the samsung galaxy s6 qichargers are getting more and more popular on amazon with new devices in all different shapes and forms coming out weekly yes it will be even more popular now but that doesnt mean it was just a niche product before
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Awais Yousaf;iv been watching fishers video for a long time now i always appreciate how good mkbhd videos looked and sounded but i guess mr mobile is my new favorite such an amazing amount of effort ps mkbhd also freaking awesome dont get me wrong here
iPhoneX;MrMobile;tony benard;i find your video and review so fake u are not sincere unless your review is basically your personal taste which reminds to ask is this video for yo personal view or followers r u a tech fanatic or just a bandwagon
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lewis Lr;what about 8 and9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;50old gamer;what a expensive crap really man
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Johnny Doe;to sum it up this doesnt have a fingerprint scanner headphone jack usb 31type c memory card or dual sim like the g6v30s8 has a lesser resolution shorter aspect ratio ugly essentialer cut out on the front and the back looks kinda ugly too but thats just my opinion its also glass which is not as strong as the ceramic back going around in a bunch of android oems to top it all off its more expensive than the better competitors
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Johnny 1 Gear;so not only has your fingerprint been recordednot thy will link your face to your print bravo apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Macky Clemen;is it weird that gestures remind me of the blackberry playbook
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Random Drunken Serb;writing it iphone x but pronouncing it iphone ten is very very stupid very very apple

iPhoneX;MrMobile;riki;the bezel at the top will disturb you when playing game or watching video
iPhoneX;MrMobile;38-Slug;4k 60fps and 1080p 240fps thats amazing why dont android have that sure enough the snapdragon 835 can handle that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shahriar Ahmed;overhyped overpriced üòè
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;its not about who does it first its about who does it better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayank Gupta;as an android user i hate to say apple did it but hate not for ios but because of inflation itll cause in mobile market it happened during neymar and itll happen next year in mobile market but good thing apple improved a lot of old android features and implemented them best way but android customisation will fill the software gap winwin for everyone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A98hzm3D;the side bezel is 2007
iPhoneX;MrMobile;arpan roy;plz stop praising this shit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justian Edzard Maulana;608 you are absolutely right about those gestures when i got into bb10 in 2012 maybe the gestures is something i really love even now i still miss those gestures from bb10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arjun Chaks;mr mobile 60fps videos curing cancer all over the world
iPhoneX;MrMobile;manoj mondal;i dont like the design of iphone x that bezel at the top of the phone looks very ugly there should be no bezels at all or there should be  bezels both at the top and at the bottom of the phone there is no symmetry in this design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moritz  Engelhardt;in germany over 1100 eur for the 64gb iphone x and they showed it live face id doesnt work probablyno way and at first apple has to pay the 13 billion eur taxes they have withdrawn in the eu bevore i gave them some of my hard earned money
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dave Kos;i agree the swipe gesture that replaces home button is genius apple dont just digitize the round home button it transforms it thats where android cant compete with apple the gesture solution is easy intiitive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Jenkins;i wonder what the cross over of apple users and cosmetic surgery fanatics is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SAW9;props to that quick editing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arbstel Bleu;the phone is ugly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Bourke;michael gday from sydney aus quick lg watch related question has something happened i turned of auto on when wrist tilting and i am getting 2 days of battery life with full notifications access how about you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;molimits2;michael its clear apple wants people to use face id so the marketing machine on their innovation works  but cant help feel they ignore what customers want apple was the phone that just works fingerprint scanner and headphone jack work there is no way a face scanner works better  maybe just as good at most but not better  so why remove it cant buy this for one minute that its good for consumers only for apple  great video otherwise always love watching yours first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M Stuart;bad design and the price is just taking the piss  but at least theyve finally discovered oled and wireless charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shahan Gilani;no one except lewis form unbox therapy mentioned about the failed face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Naveen Mahadeva;cant believe i disagree with all of your points really disappointed with the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Zionessus;people bring up the problem with identical twins like everyones got one
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hubert SAMUT;best iphone x review so far especially because of the perspective you give about every feature very good job
iPhoneX;MrMobile;oiman01011010;lol the face recognition is just bullshit it only your eyes for unlocking thats why they even specified that if you dont look directly at it it wont unlock and that why it doesnt work with a mask of the owner its just another iris scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qwertworks;i am of course a bit put off by the price but it looks very cool i am especially thrilled for the gesture controls gestures are awesome the only thing that annoys me is that you now have to reach up for the controlcentre  that is very unintuitive if you ask me  i hate it when things are out of my thumbs reach
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JBroMCMXCI;apple is shit samsung is best
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lu√≠s Vilas Boas;you are very much right all the new stuff from iphone x is already here for years but now is used by an iphoneso is newü§£ü§£üòÇ the only thing new is the screen and also that isnt new theres alot phones with something like it now

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gulshan Kumar;now waiting for microsoft surface phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gulshan Kumar;wow iphone x is the first iphonei am really excited about apple really nailed it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kayla;of all the iphone impressions videos ive watched today yours is undoubtedly the most enjoyable its not new content but your commentary always makes things more entertaining youre definitely my favorite tech youtuber
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheConsciousOne;fingerprint sensor is so much better than face id no question goodbye apple  total joke d
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Average Joe;i dont want to carry around a cd sized charger a plug is just fine with me i think the x is a crippled failure releasing a 64gb version is a insult it is not really bezel free just look at the ugly chunk at the top of the phone i am really anticipating the real reviews once people stop sucking apples dong and are honest about these phones i bet they shatter at a 3ft drop what amazed me was that the 8s look just like the 6 the emoji crap was embarrassing to watch and no one applauded the game
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Constant Culture;soiphones 911 next year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr Crutches Bob;speaking of the sony xperia xz series will you be doing anything for the xz1 and its 3d scanning properties thanks for the videos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fluffy Greyfoot;im still salty about the headphone jack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gautham Arya;stupid inference this is combo of old features sold at premium using the brand value
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Simple Help Productions;1149 no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Henkam Gangte;why are people already hating on this the x model is absolutely drop dead gorgeous to me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BrazilianTurtle;talking about old features could you do some classic techgadgets again
iPhoneX;MrMobile;P. Vivek;apple is bringing in electronic sim inside apple watch so you dont need to buy another mobile phone connection thats really bad and its really innovation no video is highlighting this fact

iPhoneX;MrMobile;P. Vivek;iphone x magic is back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Grabovskiy;only issue is apple still makes compromises for the stupidest reasonswhy not put a finger print scanner on the back i used to be stocked on face unlock on android and it worked reasonably well untill it was like 5pm too dark sorry appleeither give me the full package or just forget about me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Crazcompart;although its packed with features its just too expensive for my blood
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Thanh Tran;you forgot the hideous cyclops stolen from essential
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bao Pico;remove front cam  fake id  better display
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Manish Balam;im so happy that the iphone x is out that means the price of the iphone 7 will go down and the price of the iphone 6 will go down too so maybe ill be able to afford the iphone 4
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tanvir Hassan Dip;best youtuber in the world
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Karthick Gayan;as always your video gave a different approach rather of any other reviewers videos i seen keep up the unbiased good work which other reviewers failed to do over years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ziyab Najeeb;apple air power dd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Henderson Moyle;another awesome video thanks michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;face recognition is still just another way to unlock your phone  do you seriously need all that protection
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lesley Harrys;no promotion baffling its a nice phone but there simply isnt enough to make me switch back to iphone i really wanted to but there is not enough to justify paying nearly double of what the v30 or mix 2 will cost me sure ios is way better and the iphone x is better in a few ways but i dont like the look i dont like not having a home button whatsoever and face unlock is slower and less convenient than touchid  its the first iphone since the 3g came to the netherlands that im not buying not on day one and not for 1200 euros 1350
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;for any sour grape android user wanting to convince someone to hate apple or pick a phone that you prefer dont bother android has 2b active users they should be fine
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheCaptainBaker - TCS;huawei mate 10 will be better people might buy that instead its gonna be announced before the new iphone goes on preorder
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sandy Sandy;the iphone face recognition failed during the presentation itself lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rey Dawid;thanks for saying the truth because apple say things that make people think that there the first ones to do something but thats not true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tiger Gray;iphone is out dated sorry but it is true lg v30 galaxy s8 and moto z2 are the real innovation for 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chadwin Deysel;number bonus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maxx Tan;mikes got some mad narrative skills
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Devilicious Innocent;as always apple introduce old technology like its new n isheeps praises them like wow innovation lol anyways apple is far behind in features üòØ gr8 videoüëç
iPhoneX;MrMobile;laharrison53;the wireless charging is ok but what if you have to charge it while you  are in your car  i dont want to have to stop some where just to charge my phone i also want to be able to use my phone while it is charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaqib Bora;so will we finally see mr fisher using iphone as his main device
iPhoneX;MrMobile;geek;lol at people who hates and bash iphone but im pretty sure when that thing hits the market those haters will buy one sure theyre not anymore the first to implement  innovate new technology  but insteadthey are now implementing the technology the right way the seamless possible way to use it which is more important than putting the technology first but fail at once
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Leon C;tbh that home button could have done a lot more
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maslah Mason;first they collected personal information then fingerprints and now faces
iPhoneX;MrMobile;WailDiagram 23;yeah blackberry gesture for a start swipe up to go home lol yep slow charge  thanks blackberry z30 forever üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;EnhancedNightmare;kind of meh actually i like the long awaited removal of chin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Peizxcv;very exciting phone to bad apple cannot build enough to satisfied all the demand and have to resort to releasing iphone 88 and charge a premium for x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;GreenStorm01;your argument for our future being a bit more futuristic now apple is aboard the wireless charging train to me is basically saying that apple somehow holds our future hostage cool things wont become reality because apple isnt implementing them that everyone else did doesnt matter anymore scary thought in the morning thanx for the vid keep up the good work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Flam3Sm0k3;they didnt mention fastcharging         or did they it was 300 am where i was watching the keynote so i was sleepy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrWazzup112;chutiye it failed on stage too deep in apples ass mr mobile
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cash Bonanza;apple used to track us with cookies phone numbers location emailetc now they have face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ultra DMX;if not for the iphone 10 and s8 note 8 would worth it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mickias mekonnen;this guy has one of the coolest tech videos it is amazing the way he does it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sumit chatterjee;iphone x is so costly that you cant even in joke about it üò≠
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ehrgeiz;i actually really like the x its unlikely i can afford it but if i came into some money id probably buy it and get a  lg v20 for home video recordingstreaming  instead im likely to get a lg v30 sometime early next year  loving the gestures as well windows 8 was misunderstood and the face id is just typical apple turning a sort of ok feature into an industry leading one  great video as always
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond Petit;bah not impressed
iPhoneX;MrMobile;iCrackr;hate to say it but youve got a point apple released a new iphone with old features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rifky Tristan;cant wait to buy v30
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nikhil Sharma;i am surprised you didnt give credit to bb os10 for all the copied gesture controls
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rivengle;here‚Äôs a thing  if you can restrict yourself from buying a new phone every 23 years the iphone‚Äôs price is quite reasonable apple supports their devices for at least 5 years and with something like the ix you can expect a ton of support again only if you can stay satisfied with one device for a long long time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evan Mansfield;iphonek
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ozan Erbekta≈ü;iphone x is a forced smartphone its almost like apple felt like they had to make something for 10th year anniversary

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rico4you;thanks michael for this perspective after the event for different view than the rest of folks impressions yes apple has demonstrated once again with a lack of creativity you copy improve and give to the masses this is their model

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Valentin Marcellin;ive been a hardcore android fanboy through the years the x has me considering playing for the other team
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;why does everyone say andriod had it first its either lg had it first or samsung or some other company not android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cash Bonanza;if getting rid of the home button is a step forward why not do it for the iphone 8 as well
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Gomes;theyve done a brilliant job with faceid the rest of the industry should be ashamed that their implementations are so half assed and lazy and if course its a cool looking phone but i still want to hang on to the home button for another 2 years and i want to downsize from my s7 edge so from the beginning i was more interested to see what the 8 would bring i was really hoping for dual cameras on the 8 but sadly thats a plus feature only so im torn get a iphone 7 with sturdy metal back for the next 2 years or a newer faster 8 with a fragile glass back will have to wait for the drop test videos i suppose
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Youngblood68;i have the s8 plus and after seeing this iphone x  and i have always been anti apple  i am seriously thinking of getting this phone damn i was impressed question will its screen be as good as the s8 plus sharp and bright

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jason Boyes;had to put price up samsung have there pants down for the screen
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeff Jarvis;a great high production video but a little overboard and generous wax lyrical about how apple has made face id better but then fail to mention that it failed on stage
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pyrosdestiny;the prices are becoming ridiculous 1000 for a phone is a joke and consumers need to talk with their wallets and tell these companies these phones are now too expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Monkey D Luffy;had to dislike mrmobile this time the ladt time apple did things better rather than doing them first noththing that iphone brought to the table that xiami samsung lg google pixle and htc havent already brought to the table
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moviefan137;iphone x no headphone jack home button or multi window still no qhd display comes with a widows peak slimmed down bezels wireless qi charging face id and ar functionality 999 usd please totally worth it such a good deal joking aside i have had enough of waiting for apple to catch up with android i am just going to buy an iphone 6s 128gb and then leave the apple iphone line behind i do not care if apple perfects features android brings to the market by waiting years after manufacturers of android smartphones such as samsung and lg bring the features to their devices and improve them how much innovation does it take for a company to copy the competition and then act like the appropriated features are the greatest new features to be added to a device since the creation of the 35mm headphone jack too soon the truth can be hard apple is no longer what it once was in fact apple looks a lot like microsoft did in the ballmer era rebranding time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Myles M;i still cant believe how apple  select this design  its not balanced and i think thats why apple has released those 8 and 8 plus models to play safe   galaxy s8 screen looks better than this
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gavla Tennis;the face unlock feature didnt even work during apples official unveiling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Merritt Cluff;nice review  its good that iphone has upped the game a little the x looks compelling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImmortalInflames;lets not forget the phone failed twice during the presentation  and thats not even considering daily life from sunglasses hair cut facial hair make up etc oled screens were invented by sony  this phone really is a tech demo of what can be done in the future except we have to pay 1000 perhaps 1400 in australia for apple to get free intel on users basically a big survey we have to pay for  to end on a positive note im glad apple is making the x look more modern rather than a coat of paint every year though this look was already achieved by the xiaomi mix  essential
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arsalaan khan;samsung misplaced the fingerprint reader making it completely useless apple took it a step further and removes it completely  google will try to beat iphone x price with their pixel xl suddenly lg v30 looks like the phone to buy in 2017

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aliff Suhaimi;why they called this iphone x why not iphone 8 its not like apple has discarded iphone 8 completely like iphone 9 because apple launched iphone 8 as well however it looks more like a refreshed iphone 7 iphone 7 special edition or se and not a new phone instead the hype train that we all aboard in at the beginning are actually routing to the iphone x instead of the iphone 8 i feel sorry for the iphone 8 it is placed in an awkward spot between the the transitional period of iphone 7 and iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vikas Gurjar;im not here to bash apple keeps on telling apple isnt first one to do it every time lmao

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeffrey Wong;999 wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaj B;id rather apple get rid of all the crap in the top make the screen uniform and put touch id in the power button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fawad Bilgrami;never seem mr mobile that excited for a device before its launch based on mkbhd the oled used didnt look brighter than his note 8 perhaps apple is over hyping it who knows  ill wait till i see it too early to say anything one thing for sure either iphone 8 is dead before it was born or apple has iphone 8 as their back up plan in case things dont work out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hurricane's channel;apple is awesome they rose up from the dead again and they do it all the time every smartphone company has their name in red and underlined
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaj B;yeah but its all nut and void by the price tag of ¬£1000 but ¬£1150 for the one you really need because 64gb isnt enough they should have started it at ¬£900 and had ¬£128gb for ¬£1000  im not getting one because i think ¬£1000 is stupid i could afford it if i really wanted to but i mean its ¬£500 more than anything iphone ive bought in the past i dont think its worth it since the new one comes out every year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kushal Brs;watching on my note 8

iPhoneX;MrMobile;„Ç¥„É≥Ëîµ;its cool to see how most of the new designs now all revert back to front and back glass panels just how the iphone 4 was back in steve jobs days not a fan of apple at all but have to give all the props to mrjobs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jed Teng;at least you did discussed the improvements of the phonenot just showing the phone itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hangga Teguh;no matter how fancy it is headphone jack is still my favorite feature so i wont buy any new smartphones with no headphone jack hell no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chinmay bapat;i am surprised about how u r still seeing positives lol maneverything about it a old worklike u said just adopted by apple this time and the prices are ridiculous taken to another level p its just exciting to see them adopt and then push ppl to actually buy those devices hilarious
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pip Hacker;my sony xperia xzp is far better then iphone x  y or z ‚úåüòú
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Morgan;im so glad you also recognize the importance of webos in our current software palm was way ahead of its time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;david G;this phone looks ok but  thousand bucks is way to much for a smartphone  ill pass
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sud maharaj;i have to disagree that apple dont do things first  but do them better this principle works both ways  tick apple first released the retina display innovation  tock samsung then improved in the retina display using oled and larger screen doing it better for 2  3 years  tick apple releases siri innovation  tock google introduces google now google assistant  doing it better  tick apple release apple pay innovation  tock samsung release samsung pay that works with nearly all existing poss doing it better  apple deny genuinely useful features  when others introduce them and then confirm that others are correct when they implement these features i see apples adoption of qi wireless charging as admittance that the industry is moving along without them why did this take so long to implement why did they hold out so long  it seems they no longer had a choice  this phone is full of comprimises the screen cutout is ugly and nonsymmetrical which detracts from the experience by obscuring on screen elements  symmetry is naturally beautiful  the lack of fingerprint scanner is a usability  accessability nightmare which adds steps to the unlock process they could have added a fingerprint reader on the back but it seems they value form over function  kudos to apple for face id though it seems to be very secure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KKB1976;boring both the video and apple products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Suzaku 4000;uh oh arya stark wont be able to open this phone then lol

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Parth Sharma;dual camera lens face recognition edge to edge display fingerprint sensor bluetooth 5 stereo speakers all have been there in the market before the game is who does it better and this company knows how to play it better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;The M6;the iphoto x is cool and all  but a 1000 for a phone with enhanced features is just too much imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pedro Scroggin;i like the design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gamesfo 100;the comments were 666 so i had to change it ur welcome
iPhoneX;MrMobile;2SidedTech;iphone x seems like a great phone but that price tag is ridiculous that super retina hd display cant compete with the s8 display or other android smartphones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gustavo A. Rios;dear mr mobile i am a fan of your style panache and overall the way you review tech however on this video i just dont understand how you did not really addressed two really big things about this iphone x  the 1st one is the epic fail apple had on stage when demonstrating in real time their new face id unlocking feature and it miserably failed that was unreal and it clearly demonstrated how it is possible that this technology is half baked and not ready for prime time yet now on this i am willing to give apple the benefit of the doubt and the mishap couldve been nothing more than an incredibly inconvenient mistake for not enabling face id first but if that was the case shame on these so called pros in their shiny new expensive building for not doing their homework and making sure that the most important feature of this new revolutionary iphone went buttery smooth they looked like beginners at best i mean cmon  2nd to me is incredible how no one is saying or at least addressing the highly unsightly black panel on top of the screen a black patch that terribly hangs over everything you do on what couldve been a beautiful and flowing edge to edge display when i was seeing all the mock ups form the plethora of sneak previews on youtube i was pretty confident that apple being great at designing elegant technology would address this horrendous black patch with software and black out a portion of the top of the screen to make this hideous thing discreet but no i was wrong now you have to endure seeing this black stain even during video playback i just dont understand how is this is acceptable under any circumstance and you mr mobile did not address this otherwise very obvious shortcomings to me these two issues make the iphone x unpurchaseable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dr. Sam X;my htc10 can shoot at 4k60 with the google camera port
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khadijah Frye;stabbing the button like a lab rat üòÇüòÇ dammit now thats how im gonna feel until i get an upgrade
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrew Iannacone;my 3ds has a dual 3d camera augmented reality two screens one of them being a 3d screen and even an audio jack beat that apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dandelion;im waiting for the new google phone i gotta see what they have this year i just hope theyll put dual speakers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Domen M;never ever ever going to use face id  remember people they warned us about chips in our bodie to tag us like kattle now you are makein it easy for them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nick S;the removal of the headphone jack was enough but now the home button fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Â≠ôËÉúËæâ;i would like to know what shape is the iphone x screenshot
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RacerC45;why the hell cant apple just bring the headphone jack for gods sake whatever happened to if it aint broke dont fix it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Handika;is it really worth a thousand dollar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kev;its unreal how ugly a phone can get by just tilting the cameras the other way
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bandy Ahmed;1000 the 64 gb how much for the 256 gb
iPhoneX;MrMobile;iMiguelAOG;im proud of apple they made a phone that goes toe to toe with the galaxy s8 now they just need a note 8 competitor
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tech Defender;once apple introduces a feature dumb or cool everyone else copies or inpliments it take wireless charging once apple releases iphone 8 itll make wireless charging a bigger thing i just hope others dont take away the fingerprint sensor for some stupid face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Professor Scot;glad you are excited but  dont you agree that many of these feature are already out of date or has proved to be a failed technology with batteries that last many days moto z play moto mod what is the point of a phone continuously charging   iris scanner means that you might as well remove any password protection to it  while i bet the camera will be great the only ones who will make money on 4k at 60 fps are cloud based companies likeapple i will be interested to see if this feature is popular who knows  ar  what is the function of this feature  great for 10 year olds serious i love baseball but i didnt see any value in the heads above the players now gestures  finalmente this will be a useful aspect to the os but i bet nova launcher will add it during its next iteration  have fun
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KornKernel;it never fails that micheal fisher is on point apple isnt known for being first to adopt certain technologies sometimes yes but mostly not thing is when they finally catch up with something because of the apples popular branding and developer support they contribute to making that technology adopted more popular and matures bit more quickly in this case about wireless charging which is a relief that they use qi wireless charging standard instead of proprietary implementation which apple typically does this will make wireless charging popular and widely adopted everywhere just like how the fingerprint authentication which is not new at all but after iphone implemented to their own all other devices quickly followed  this is basically what excites me more than the phone itself even im not even an iphone user for a very long time im looking forward to these technologies more widespread adoption benefiting us all in the long run
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SPMobile;so its not so much that apple does it better but more that because apple is doing it that itll be cool and start to trend think you should change that intro a bit michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shahril Isa;not even interested with the old tech which combines into new gadget whats wrong with apple now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Unicorn Workhorse;very refined stuff android is my city but this is pretty dope expensive as hell though

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rob Watkins;excellent observations as always sir
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael V.;were did the phrase  top up  come from  it makes no sense
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kitkat Emm;i will never understand why apple is the company that the rest of the smart phone industry looks to for adoption when the iphone doesnt make up the majority of the the smart phone market android does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Carlos Pena;is this the same intro background music for oxygen os

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Motherlov'n Jones;i have this feeling fingerprint scanners will become like headphone jacks sooner or later slowly phasing out but surely will

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Anonymus;no hell no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Prime Tambayong;iphone x is finally catching up to recent phones dont even know why they need the 8s around the 8s are not competitive on the screen front otherwise 90 of the x in components wonder how good the battery from the jump to oled even the v30 is getting better battery than the g6 missing from all of this is 120hz screen and faster charging what happened fast charging is more important than wireless charging oh well the airpower sharing of wireless charging is cute does it do 2 phones  also improved are speakers 4k 60p 1080 240 and probably the new 3d face scanner wonder how that works with ski mask
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Maaz Khan;why are you always at baseball games then if you dont care about baseball
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam Corona;apple is lame as hell
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Brewzer NM;as much as i dont like apple every time they bring up a new feature or improve an old feature they always nailed it

iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;received my note 8 today the iphone x will make a nice addition to my collection
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Christy;i dont like the iphone x at all because it feels so unapple and without the awemastic the iphone x went full samsung mode i find a lot of these features useless and gimmicky im so unimpressed i love my iphone 7 and will stick with it the bezel on the top  camera hump on the side look so ugly i love apple for their design and this phone just looks so ugly i dont care about specs if the phone looks like a galaxy from the view if i wanted to buy a galaxy i would not one with an apple logo on it to me this was terrible as i felt apple was less apple and catered to the spec nerds that love driod to join the apple clan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dango Ruiz;i draw the line at 1000 for 64gb of storage in 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A mar;no apple any more when the price is now gonna of course cross 1000 us
iPhoneX;MrMobile;oscar e;i probably will still take samsung wireless chargers because of fast wireless charging and the fact that the newest charger doubles as a pad and stand
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;i hope the video scales unlike what was shown in the event id really like to see the portion of the  video thats blocked with the sensor area
iPhoneX;MrMobile;luis alvarez;so to unlock the iphone x you have to press the power button bring your face to the screen and then slide up in which universe perform 3 steps instead of 1 is an improvement
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nolan Haynes;having followed the development demise revival and open sourcing of webos having owned a blackberry z30 and having owned various android phones i am excited to see various features and technologies come back in this form i am also saddened by the fact that it is now available on a phone whose design language is form over function whose battery life will be shorter than i am used to whose os is not open source to a good degree and does not follow open standards for crossplatform development and whose price tag is that high for what one gets
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Josh Perkins;can we talk about how creepy those animoji are
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Marcus LC;face id was a failure when they tried to demostrate

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hrithwik Bharadwaj;holy cook it did üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joseph;you know i just literally just came to the realization that this is by far the best tech phone especially youtuber there is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;joes04redrx8;really no home button or touch id i dont give a fuck what anyone says but the face unlock is an absolute joke its extremely unpractical as you have to hold the thing somewhat up to your face no more just slipping it out of your pocket for a quick peek or the half tilt move on the table to check your phone why do you think android hasnt moved forward with this because no one uses it  same with wireless charging you cant really use your phone while its charging sure its cool and all but once you wake up a few mornings with your phone only half charged because your notifications buzzing away has moved it out of place on the pad you will ditch that too
iPhoneX;MrMobile;parth soni;how can we access the recent apps from home screen  do we have to open an app swipe up from that and reach the recent apps  üòÖüòÖ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Noel Negron;omg stop with the mercari ads shes so annoying
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nilesh Ghayle;problems with face id can be the same as that of the iris scanners we already saw it failed during demo another problem ie the inefficiency under the direct sunlight may also be present as the similar ir camera which works less efficiently under the direct sunlight is used it is interesting to see how much battery drains due to the face id and if iphone x overcomes these problems what is the option if  it doesnt reverting back to pin unlocking
iPhoneX;MrMobile;David hunsinger;iphone x gimmick
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Rickard;holy crap your video is by far the best on the iphone coverage great job
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raj Patel;i heard that oled displays are supplied by samsung but during launch event they were having so proud of that screen like they invented first in the world and they call them super ratina display lol

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rafael Cisneros;that home gesture can appear while scrolling
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vijay r;very tongueincheek michael this device seems to cost a lot for  the features that it offers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;David Peterson;i really didnt think of getting a wireless charging style shell for my moto z play now that apple is qiing up i may now reconsider wireless charging seeing apple will push the standard oh wait will i get the new iphone uh hell no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Geeks Life;im pumped
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dallas Cowboys;they all copy from each other in one form or another i‚Äôll give apple credit what they copy from the competitors they do it better that price is a little steep but they‚Äôll still sale like hot cakes good video can‚Äôt wait for the full review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evelina999;i dont think that ditching the fingerprint scanner is a good idea i mean the facial recognition is cool and all but there are situations where i cant or dont really want to take out my phone and hold it up to my face just to unlock it a fingerprints scanner is just more convenient
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Juan Carlos Perez-Ortiz;thank you for telling it like it is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommy Turner;there does not seem to be a sweet spot for memory 64 gb could fill up quicker than you think if you use 4k 256 is a lot but how much of a price jump will that be iphone x seems awesome but starting at 999 ouch seems like cell phone prices are rising faster than the national debt  maybe wait for iphone 7 plus price drop to upgrade my iphone 7

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;michael fisher knows it all too well with how satisfying gesture swipes can be  iphone xs gestures  ios11  webos reincarnated  fans of webos qnxbb10 and meegosailfish would all be proud  ive been a phone fanatic since 2004 anybody who remembers webos whether on pre pixi and touchpad knows swiping up to close apps felt satisfyingly good over pressing home all the time  i hope ios adds a gesture swipe for a back action i would use my dasher and usually need to close the app because there is no back action anywhere thats where android beats ios it still has the useful back action  this is the single reason why i want to return to iphone as a daily driver i see the future very much wireless too so i dont care about headphone jack im not just buying the iphone x im also going to purchase the apple watch air pods and airpower  make the halo effect and ecosystem more complete its not just getting the x once you taste the entire apple you may never use another platform again the iphone x may not be the best phone ever made its not even revolutionary but its the best iphone ever made  final fantasy x  iphone x  the last great entry from a legendary series 10 is it downhill after this galaxy x with foldable displays is the next revolution in the industry the iphone x is just a tribute song to the original iphones influence and past decade  happy 10 iphone üéÇ üéÇ

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingjay814;i agree with a lot of your points apple is popular and if they adopt features that other phones have had then itll be more mainstream tango for example asus is the only one whos got something for that with apple innovating ar well see that get more mainstream im especially jazzed about the wireless charging honda and chevy have qi charging pads in some of their cars id love for that to eventually be the norm in the future

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Roshan Chachane;apple is betting its all on those bunch of sensors but hey let us not talk about the low res screen poor camera functionality in comparison to lg or huawei copying of gesture features from out of market phones so that no notices keeping the same old archaic design from 4 generations straight still no dual windows hideously protruding camera like some street lights unwieldy and wide and these features will soon appear on tons of chinese phones with half the price

iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;i hate apple and that those bastards are trying to make it seem like all these features are crazy new innovation you do bring up a good point however that apple adding this stuff will make it more mainstream which is beneficial for us android users still the fact that they make it more difficult for everyone by still insisting to use their own software makes me hope that more and more people come to realize how apple simply doesnt make the best phones and switch over
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ian McLean;looks like the most interesting iphone apple has done in ages i really dig the look of it

iPhoneX;MrMobile;T-MEX;used to be an iphone user back in the iphone 1 and iphone 4 days been in android lately but now it looks like ill give apple another try with iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael mu.;though i dont like apple i still do watch apple because they set a example they are what most other companies try to replicateor do better in order to surpass them i hope that the face id will go off i honestly think it has the potential of the fingerprint scanner but we will have to wait and see
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fazd Ahmad;yes apple maybe late but they do it right look how good their applewatch as compared to gear s3 i had now till now samsung has fails to integrates app in s3 photo still cant be viewed for whatsappfbig
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aditya Prakash;note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vaibhav Dhorta;they should have embedded touch id in the apple logo on back of the phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;shashwat panda;see thats what i love about mrmobiles videos context and perspective each point is well supplemented by a slice of tech history and how it might change the tech landscape in the near future  honestly i am more positive and satisfied with this video than the whole of apples event
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Danny Tanase;iphone x camera still looks stupid  and that center bezel looks dumb
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr. Cheesedoodles;living in canada with our outrageous exchange rate i am torn between buying a 6s or a 7 to upgrade to from my nexus 5 the 6s is 599 cad and the 7 is 739 cad the 6s plus is the same price as the 7 and the 7 plus is the same price as the 8 at 899 which is too much imo im totally fine with 32gb of storage and while i do like android i want a more consistent experience this time while both the 6s and the 7 are in my budget i am leaning towards the 6s because of the 140 difference and the headphone jack but i really want my next phone to be water resistant and i can live with a dongle can someone give some advice
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cesar Munir;did you watch the keynote the guy couldnt unlock the iphone with his face üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;HaSeeB MiR;why they removed home button and touch id thats a big downgrade from previous year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lester Dimaoala;going over to ios from android doesnt look that bad anymore as it was a couple of years ago just preordered the note8 hopefully i made the right choice üò•
iPhoneX;MrMobile;HaSeeB MiR;why theyremoved home button and touch id thats a big downgrade from previous year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dave Elzacky;the most mobile reviewer ever üëèüëèüëè youre the man michael üëäüëä
iPhoneX;MrMobile;You are breathing;im happy that apple finally has wireless charging so more public places can have wireless chargers so i dont need to worry about sketchy usb ports but personally i dont use it because i cant use my phone while charging even with fast charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Francisco Fernandez, Jr.;the iphone x is the bestlooking phone ever released by apple it looks like a modern android phonetho theyre still sacrificing function over simplicity
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pito VH;yes i agree with this video if all this big corporations have to copy each other to move the technology forward i say go for it all we have to do as consumers is defend the prices and dont let them rape us i want the iphone x even though is way overpriced but when i find out applecare is 200 and have no extra features shit 100 more now apple is playing greedy  they are really fucking us over the youtube tech community have to speak for us because the price are too damn high
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Michael Beverley;god i miss web os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;James W;michael thanks for the blast to techs past with informing people of the history of the features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;McRocket;first to me the best reviewfirst impressions  so far  that i have seen of the new iphone  second apple is very slowly dying this is bland nothing but evolution zip revolution jobs apple was about revolution among other things taking chances with new ideas andor new ways to do things it was little to do with the best tech  but a new way of using existing techthat few had considered the iphone and the ipad to name but a few apple gadgets were revolutionary all the iphone 8 and x are is evolutionary very expensive evolutionary sure apple will sell a ton and make a ton off of these but if this is the future of apple  take no chances and just be evolutionary then apples days as the cool tech source for people with some bucks are numbered oh its a big number but they are numberedguaranteed btw  my phone and tablet are appleso i am not an apple hater
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Zachary Wirfs;the video was great but another example of how apple has stolen tech from blackberry
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jason Wilde;this is still just a crap ton of playing catch up with a few actual unique improvements and a ridiculous price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;fadhil priana;now every other brand will ditch finggerprint sensor from their new smartphone line up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Karthik Pullela;at 329 you can expect samsung and other manufacturers to up their game yes unlike apple they always respond to challenges in innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;King‚Äôs Audience;apple will take away the head phone jack then the home button then the volume button then your hard earn moneywhy courage
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Minh Pham;i still prefer touch id over face id so far nothing beats the speed and convenience of fingerprint scanner
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SleepyHalos;while i dont care for apple its nice to them finally adopt these features to their phones now these features can get more exposure so its a win win for all consumersdont get me wrong i still have some problems i sill hate  the lack of headphone jack i need the near unlimited customisation of android and that 999 price tag are all deal breakers for me with is why im getting th lg v30

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jos√© Javier Velasco;i loved the way you let us notice that the new features on the iphone x arent really new but they will help to improve existing features and get newer ones on future devices from apple and other manufacturers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;IamAce;watch complete iphone intros from iphone 2g to iphone x 10 2007 to late 2017 in my channel

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Arcade Party;i didnt realize it was april 1st
iPhoneX;MrMobile;The Doctor;great video as always and i will be a subscriber  i hope faceid works well enough where people wont be missing touchid swiping up once the iphone recognizes your face seems like a bit of an inconvenience well see i guess
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeremy C.;imore videos are terrible jeez send this guy to apple events man what a waste of an invitation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;trueblue4l1f3;good thing samsung led the way in innovation or else iphone x wouldnt even have these so called new features lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Music Lyrics;what do people do with their old iphones selltrade it in for the new one att next is another good option
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Cole Byre;i had the pre back in the day even bought the bb z10 to get gestures back really happy the iphone x will be based on gesture control just wish theyd work harder on maps and bring split screen to the iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dubbytheman;that face id sketches me out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nandan Agnihotri;awesome video michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke Carapezza;if this wasnt so highly priced i think that people would enjoy it morethen again its similar to the note 8 even if there are similar phones out there that will have a significantly lower price if you wait 3 months v30 people will still buy it because its what they know in the us where iphones are a big part of the phone market people will buy apple because its what they know
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pxintman;the a11 is the only feature i care about
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rakesh Botadkar Saiman Bobbypins;wicked video mike yeah i agree that the iphone 10 actually makes me think that theyve actually done things better than android this time

iPhoneX;MrMobile;David Vazquez;we have some new features but still wont upgrade to a quad hd screen seriously 699 for phone with a resolution of 750p apple makes awesome screens but just imagine how better they would with a higher resolution and their gonna charge 1000 for a phone with a 1080p screen no headphone jack no fingerprint sensor and no capacitive buttons at least are you fucking kidding me bro this is worse than the note 8 and dont get me started on that piece of shit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;angelo tarantino;jesusthis design is a shitty clone from the galaxy s8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kofuzi;im with you on the palm pre loved that phone

iPhoneX;MrMobile;angelo tarantino;nothing newwe saw the fail of this revolutional phone in the apples videono only one with a little bit of brain will buy itandroid still best
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Henrique Vefago;will someday apple change change de iphone plug to usbc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Draken0023;face id no simple doubleclick for app switching swiping down for notificationscontrol center still no usbc is the taptic engine still in the iphone x its all just meh chunky bezels on the apple watch are still a thing too i thought 2017 was gonna be awesome for tech its all just incremental or recycled iphones with irregularlyshaped oled displays is new i guess why cant apple just give up on the lightning bs its old and it sucks macbooks and imacs have already adopted usbc and thunderbolt 3 so why in the world would apple keep such an outdated io on their revolutionary new device i dont give two craps about the headphone jack and anyone still arguing about it is wasting their breath apples not gonna bring it back to the iphones period shut up but were still using lightning this would have been the perfect time to ditch it instead they ditched the friggin home button i was so thoroughly disappointed in the note 8 and its lackluster spec sheet that id hoped apple would blow our doors off nope no pro motion either how sweet would ar look at 120hz im not too shocked by the price considering its apple but you can get the 129 ipad pro 2 with 512gb of internal storage and lte capability for 1229 dont want lte then its still 50 less than the 256gb iphone x at 1099 maybe 2018 will be better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vernon Tauro;oh come on they invented everything
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MiracleWarriors;you forgot to add that now glass sandwich design is more futuristic then having a metal back panel a phone can do more with glass on the back be more lightweight and so users have to understand that this is a necessary evil over the more bunker feel of a phone with aluminum back panel from outer space
iPhoneX;MrMobile;fckin ksmzo;it looks like shit

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Darnell Willison;dont understand people hating on the price most of the people buying this phone are apple fans who are willing to pay the apple premium sure you can find these features on cheaper android phones but this device isnt for the people buying those phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ketan Chotai;home key is impossible to live without
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TheFearedPhantom;thanks samsung and apple for stepping up your game your move google
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sowande;ayyyhaayyy aahhhaahh aahaahhhhh aayyeeahhhh  lol love it i skipped the note 8 and this and i got a galaxy folder 2 and  i love it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;johnathanblade1;its a nice looking device i thought that the faceid tech was well presented soooo much hyperbole though the first amoled screen good enough for iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LeBeautiful;okay applenows the time to do something a little more captivating than  wireless charging man my nexus 4 back in 2012 had this featureand the thing is its qi too  augmented reality yup phones been doing this for a whilea memorable example is the sony xperia z2  oled display new tech meets hype you guys remember the afromented lg flex phones yup they had 2k oled first  bezeless design come on now over 10 years yet weve been seeing it as early as some sharp aquos phones and now with the s8  g6v30 and the xiaomi mixes  all for 999
iPhoneX;MrMobile;All Religions are fake;am i the only one who doughts on capabilities of face id coz i watched the whole show and that guy couldnt open iphone x in first attempt frankly speaking fingerprint scanner works much faster i usually unlock my device before getting it in front of my face and lastly what happens in the case of identical twins
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Irfan Khan;your review was more impressive that apples keynote
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;i wonder what happens if an iphone x owner has an accident and have a face disfigurement hmmmmmmm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qolam Reza Rezaei;nokia n9 was the leader of swipe ui
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Track Sparny;apple could have used the both finger print and facial recognition of the security features but it didnt which is disappointing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alric Sharif;just for infosamsung face recognition cant be fooled with a photo anymoreeven in s8 if u have one just try it before slaming mei just didi wont unlock with a photo

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mdabul Hossain;finally a good phone made by apple
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Freshly Squeezed;i can see why someone who has the money for this and has been really waiting for an iphone worth upgrading would want this but ive been searching everything from the underdogs all the way to the top dogs but compared to all of those the iphones just get more boring as the years go by if youre a really big tech nerd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paul John Angel;a very comprehensive impression of the phone stay mobile

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gov3rningEight;been a apple fan for a couple years now i currently have the 7plus but i have to say the new iphones just dont seem worth the money  the x is amazing looking but their are so many androids out their woth the same if not more features than the x and 8 for example look at the v30 beast of a phone when i upgrade in december i think my money will be with the v30 or wait for the s9 in january
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;545 he brought up webos rip
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Salis Salman;holy cook what i fail to understand about apple approach on faceid isnt touchid much faster and more convenient than faceid its just another caveat now indeed its a neat feature but doing away with the tried and trusted touch id which so many apps support and so many people trust is just ugh no words
iPhoneX;MrMobile;TeeBakes;idk i respect apple for finally removing those large bezels but they are sacrificing a home key i like physical interfaces and removing the home key is like chopping off a ring finger some people would be fine without it but other would miss having the finger a wedding ring or a sesame ring in this case for michael
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ed lonzy;microsoft has been doing the facial recognition really well for a while now windows hellos is really good

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Qory Azkia;dani podis fuck you israel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;walisson guimaraes ive spent 1000 on hookers might as well spend a 1000 on porn watching on the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KeybladeScar;yash akkara because i wanted the x at first but apple made me upset about it i mean its a cool idea but i just feel like apple should have made the x the ultimate phone but if ever upgrade ill be getting the 8 plus anyway but my 7 plus will be with me for a long time lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;if you are not gonna buy it then why tf do u care
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KeybladeScar;pamplonahd haha i have my iphone 7 plus ill be okay for a very long time üòÅüòÅ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;keybladescar c you can have the iphone 8 then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ashley Davies;pamplonahd haha true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;ashley davies at least it didnt blow up in the custumer faces  like some other products outhere
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bryce Jian-Roy Carin;christian at least its not as nonsense as the way you spell products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;it actually has 60 hrs audio so we can listen to music constantly for 2 and a half days
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;you guys just dont get it do you even the video said it its not about who did it first its about who did it better youre logic is that you would buy a worse phone just because it came first 1010
iPhoneX;MrMobile;spritewon;pamplonahd i dont see how i am being stupid but the reason i watch mrmobile is because he is more critical on his videos than other tech channels and any other time he would have mentioned the price such as with the note 8 which was ridiculously high as well and the only reason i am using the note 8 is because i had a note 7 and got 425 off
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;spritewon just trolling or simply dumb
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;yash akkara o u must didnt see the video where it failed on stage at the keynote
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;unlike facial iris scanning on android this cant be fooled there are legit videos on youtube that show them failing and they dont work well in low light apple tackled all of these and their face id is 20x more secure than touch id they even went this far to make 3d masks by professionals and the iphone even tackled that maybe not new but far far better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Montrez Porter;c3 u didnt have to say the no shit part cuz i actually agree with u my guy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;C3;montrez porter no shit most iphone users arent nerds that follow the industry all they know is iphone and any feature will always be new to them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;–¥–µ—è–Ω –∏–ª–∏–µ–≤ yah apple is going to flip alright
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;ryan collins me too i prefer the aluminum back it feels more premium glass backs are just more chances to crack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Asher Perlmuter;samuel james do they need to be apples proprietary butt cheeks or will it work with the industry standard
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;asher perlmuter put it in between your butt cheeks and squeeze
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;tony benard yeah i agree the real innovation is what one plus does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;luke williams digital bezel lmfao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;luke williams no it does not technically have less bezels than samsung galaxy note 8 note 8s screen to body ratio is higher watch the video
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;optimus27 i think it looks sexy and also its a matter of opinion and plus it looks cool a snit actually technically has less bezels then samsung note 8 because it has a digital bezel with home button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;rihasanat rofolo modern design i thought that too till they throwed in a fat over sized brick with huge bezels around the entire phone with a nasty looking dimmick at the top middle of the screen no thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;User0225;lol those are not bezels the screen itself floats and curves and does not sit on bezels lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;daTutankabron;rihasanat rofolo the black thing on the top makes it ugly af
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lars Bolduc;it actually is ugly the bezels are quite large compared to many other phones the bezels remind me of the original iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rihasanat rofolo;how is that ugly one of the most modern designs out there you must have a poor taste in design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Absolutelypriyansh;gulshan kumar check it out  httpsyoutubeuq6ikv6caiu
iPhoneX;MrMobile;that boy;youtube red 1k is overpriced u fucking spoiled white kid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;cultusdeus;dont forget you also have to buy the wireless charger and cord to use the wireless charging as well more money christmas this year may be a one gift holiday if people break down and even get it to begin with that is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bass Based;you mean 1799 nzd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris Malaspinas;sunny sandhar what this is ridiculous
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Holly Hsieh;note 8 is cheaper than iphone 8 plus here xd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Heng Theng;it fuckkng 1700 here maybe 1900 wtf
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Holly Hsieh;also add 84 for fast charge
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond AKP;youtube red its because we have high taxes and whenever we buy a product 25 of the price goes directly to the state moms
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;raymond akp that‚Äôs really expensive why almost twice as expensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;samuel james t mobile is doing the trade in for the iphone and att is doing buy one get one free on the iphone 8 also the iphone x is 33 dollars a month from my carrier no one pays full price for phones unless you dont care
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;my problem with android is that it is not well designed because of the abuse of user options i see customisation as a tiny benefit as it only changes the aesthetics and sometimes how things function from a design standpoint the amount of customisation android gives is more of a huge disadvantage it gives the user too many options which confuse non techsavvy users theres a design principle called the flexibilityusability tradeoff that states that limiting user actions can improve usability and that extremes on either side are really bad ios has a good balance of flexibility and usability android does not android chaotically smashes into a wall it gives too many options and disrupts a proper balance and flexibility and usability but typically fandroids dismiss this because they think the user should just learn the os better however i say the goal of a designer is to build an interface that is intuitive and requires little brainprocessing android fails at this and therefore fails as a simpletouse os the amount of customisation options within the ui is too large and requires a high to huge learning curve however those who are willing to overstep this learning curve may find a liking to the amount of fine control however we cannot call android well designed the majority of human beings do not have the time available to learn an os to many an os should just do its job and get out of the way with the extra fluff and is the reason many choose ios over android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;3165dwayne;eddie r if people were smart and started voting with their wallets that price would fall
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raymond AKP;in denmark 64 gb version costs 8899 dkk 1430 usd and 256 gb costs 10249 dkk 1647 usd
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;joshua sandoval just stop with your iphone buugaa buugaa every android phone is unique just like every windows pc is unique nothing surprising there whether you liked it or not android is far too superior to ios in terms of customization and software variety every person with an iq of over 30 should be able to use an android phone otherwise there is something wrong with you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;when iphone fixes its software and adds all the necessary features thas when ill change to an iphone  youre fng joking right android is way worse than ios will ever be ios is fast intuitive and seamless android is not android does have a lot of features but is too crammed with features and it honestly it becomes really disorganized and confusing not to mention that every android phone is unique adding further to its problem
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;optimus27 poor ass 1k isnt overpriced for an iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Optimus27;luke williams i like iphones speed and fluency however the phone it self is way too restricted and lacks simple features that android phones have when iphone fixes its software and adds all the necessary features thas when ill change to an iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;optimus27 hey the iphone 8 is a solid amazing upgrade and is 700 which is cheap in 2017 and is worth it an apple is selling  all new lines from 6s and more for 10th anniversary
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lee Squires;simple help productions ok thank you for letting us know
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yahia Mostafa;from the phone ad they said the technology would work well in the dark
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tiger Gray;chris liberti 1000k no thanks lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Liberti;tiger gray i tried both the s8 and moto z2 force  both are ok but they don‚Äôt work with handoff and such for me  i returned to iphone and will be getting the x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;geek;maybe you missed steve jobs sorry hes dead  we can only enjoy whats being offered today  is that making you sad killing you me enjoying all the tech both apple and android while im still alive yolo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RD Simmers;geek hahaha im still going to point and laugh at all the idjits paying 1000 for the name and i was an early adopter of both apple ii and macintosh just dont like the way the company has gone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Everett Bonds;apple got to make enough to pay samsung to make the iphone 10
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RD Simmers;sell to the masses at an exorbitant price fixed it for you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;jimmy pai try look at the mirror before judging beauty
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jeff Jarvis;pamplonahd the android flagships already have it microsoft already has it with windows hello implemented by a whole of range of pc makers well not apple obviously hey i think it‚Äôs great that apple has finally caught up with wireless charging and waterproofing too great also to see them opting for slimmed down bezels well not the iphone 8 or 8 plus that‚Äôs still the same 4yr old design but the iphone x finally looks more flagship android and that can only benefit consumers i assume you do like a gorgeous large oled screen we‚Äôve loved em for years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;jeff jarvis in threee years from now all android phones will have a similar face id implementation apple leads others follow
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;arsalaan khan you have to a really spastically retarded person to not be able to use the fingerprint scanner like fully retarded child spastic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;poeglives;arsalaan khan my thoughts exactly the phone that understands bluetooth isnt a substitute for for a high end dacamp and that some music collections drastically exceed others
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrSpaghetti;so stating actual facts  bashing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fendera;that is only proof that the cpu is more powerful
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;that 3gb ram kills the note 8s 6 gb by a 2000  benchmark  rip
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;fendera tell me what could possibly be gained from an iphone x with six gigs of ram for example versus one with three gigs of ram tell me 100 what value ios would have with six gigs of ram versus three
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John Green;fake facts to make apple look good nothing new while your at it be sure to microwave your iphone for fast charging
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;linusmlgtips ya really cool feature üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;sudarshanmaharaj uhhh samsung has been doing oled longer than that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rafi Yagami;even that face id fails to work at the event lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sud maharaj;linusmlgtips samsung pay is a different beast it uses  nfc  mst tech which allow it to function with the majority of legacy payment systemsmagnetic card readers it also allows for online payment such as amazon  by your own admission these are weird sides the fact that apple allows you to black out this ugly cutout is only further confirmation of a design compromise your also losing screen size if you do this
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LeGoogle Chrome;linusmlgtips he mentioned samsung pay for a reason bud also how is apple pay better than android pay anyways its literally the same system nfc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LinusMLGTips;sudarshanmaharaj two things theres an option in ios 11 so you can black out the top so it looks a lot cleaner than having those weird sides also apple pay was better than google wallet for the time period
iPhoneX;MrMobile;am3ient;lars bolduc marketing terms like infinity display lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lars Bolduc;lol retina doesnt have a meaning its just marketing retina displays were not innovations and phones have always had higher ppi than the iphone also samsung supplies the displays apple uses in the iphone saving the best ones for their phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LeGoogle Chrome;sudarshanmaharaj yeah face id is probably the best facial recognition system out in the market right now but the fingerprint scanner is a solid choice dont know why they couldnt just add one to the back
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;dr sam x please do a demo on that that sounds cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;it‚Äôs a rectangle
iPhoneX;MrMobile;suvrat sharma;holy shit  didnt think about that a really good question though ü§î
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Â≠ôËÉúËæâ;emmmmm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MyHairyChin;yash akkara  its ok your blinded by apple ohh and canada ftw üá®üá¶
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;my hairy chin does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Prime Tambayong;also ios dont lend to good long screen display hard to reach the top should have made the clock bigger or have the music widget on top
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;dango ruiz what if i told you you could get 256 gb for 800 and it was made by apple gasp
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;marcus lc will you people give it a chance like come on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;syren serpe no 600 should be the most
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;pls buy the iphone 8 and shut that hating trap thanks  logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;James Penwright;agree  i will be sticking to my 6s as touch id is very convenient for me  face id is a joke
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;joes04redrx8 shut up you know you cant live without iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;joes04redrx8 makes sense to me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nilesh Ghayle;what will those folks who were criticized iris scanners heavily because the phone had to hold in front of the face when it could be unlocked immediately while taking out of the pocket using touch id say now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;pamplonaHD;vijay r what did you expect a curved screen a microscopic stylus and a ton of bloatware yeah thats innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Godson Eh;you sound like a female on ios emotionally driving
iPhoneX;MrMobile;fattah qalbu;damn i cant agree even more im and adroid fan but just because the ios is not so userfriendly but damn this iphone x is totally mind blown for me im really hype for this year smartphone now ill just have to wait for the mate 10 i reallr do hope the mate 10  ould give the iphone x a really solid run for the money and hardware
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andrew;geeks life i hate ios and other iphones but damn i gotta admit the iphone x or 10 is really tempting the camera performance even face id looks better and the fact its similar to android by sliding down for the control panel is awesome
iPhoneX;MrMobile;let's begin gaming;yash akkara lol what the fuck are you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krishna Adettiwar;ddd bbb you dont have to hold it up to your face because it senses depth based on the demo on stage it unlocked perfectly and he didnt raise it up or anything to look at the phone theyve made new chips and its the first phone to have these chips and sensors and a neural engine dedicated to this so its in another league compared to facial recognition and iris scanning on other phones theyre claiming its supposed to be even more secure by a long shot than touch id which is pretty insane
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;pls buy the iphone 8 thanks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ddd Bbb;evelina999 then use password dont be stupid  using password is cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Keino but you can call me Kei.;kingslayer controllers are the whole function of the console i dont want to spend extra for wireless crap
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;m√¶ko nobody is asking for wired controllers to return for the next playstation or xbox get with the times buy airpods
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;ayush zaheer  webos 2009 qnxbb10 20112013 meegosailfish 20112013  some 2011 ui returns in 2017
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;dominick brown 3ds and vita had it years ago  actually ar existed with sekai camera in 2008 when i watched the keynote this morning it feels like ar is really vr but without the headset you end up moving alot more while playing games im more into ar for educational stuff that sekai camera showed or word lens which google bought to add into their google translate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;- XPL0S1V3 -;5 clicks on the power button and it disables fingerprint and face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pety;abh037 oh thats actually really cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abh037;theres a quick shortcut to disable biometric authentication on iphones im not sure what itll be on the x but on my 7 plus its pressing the side button five times after that youre required to enter your password
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Scrom Diugh;or just dont get in trouble with the police seriously when has an officer asked you to unlock your phone are you a criminal
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Pety;they can do that with any biometric login since its not protected under the fifth amendment of course talking about the us if that concerns you i would go with the pin or password
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Andre S;well its broken so tadaaa fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sole Nation;close ur eyes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;YouTube Red;krystal myth yes it does alphanumeric pass codes are allowed on iphone a
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ali CHAHIN;well they can force you to open it by holding your finger to the touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eli Czaplinski;nfamouz princezz good things twins are pretty rare then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;nfamouz princezz you have to keep your eyes open to use the 3d facial scanner for security reasons  httpsqzcom1073209whatisapplesnewfaceidandwhyisitreplacingthefingerprint
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NFamouz Princezz;de techie facial recognition isnt the same as an iris scanner closing your eyes would do nothing also a twin could unlock your phone üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Lamoa;paulson thomas ü§£ü§£ü§£ true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Team3Gaming;krystal myth yes all iphones allow that üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Team3Gaming;paulson thomas cant they do the same with touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;jack calow jesus you guys are the seed of our demise should just let them put a camera in your house because you have nothing to hide
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jack calow;dont break the law then lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;JUNIORFAKE;m i c h lol these women cant have an iphone now lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;sam m women in burqas dont use facial recognition maybe iris scanner haha theyre stuck in the 7th century and they hate vitamin d
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;they can also do that with your fingers right now if you use touch id neither system is more physically secure although apparently you can close your eyes or avert looking at the phone with face id  this is the second dumbest criticism ive seen of face id the first dumbest being it discriminates against women in burkas
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;gameguy thats true but its not really a monopoly because android is open source
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;ndsb true but that‚Äôs what happens in every other market like gamingpctablets etc if there was one os it would be a monopoly in the phone market it‚Äôs good to have competition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;NDSB;gameguy does it not make things more difficult for everyone apps have to be coded for two different operating systems unless they only want to be available on one
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;so your saying that your opinion is fact and other opinions are incorrect
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jerrod voong preach  nobody is asking for wired controllers for the next playstation or xbox

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;charlie surface is the best tablet bruh it runs full blown pc os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;charlie thats tru dude it beats almost all home  pcs even some gaming ones smh alex
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alex Smailes;charlie no its not
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;the ipad pro is the best tablet on the market though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;derSchwarzkopf;now srsly should they say at the unveiling ohh by the way our tablets are way inferior than the other ones i wouldnt recommend them
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;alex smailes always have been sents jobs died
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ihsan Husandi;i am against the bezelless trends but it turned out i kinda like apples approach towards the trends than the rest of markets
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;buy the iphone 8 they released it for a reason
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ash89;glasssofoj  oh okay i dont give two shits about gaming on my phone so bezelless is the way to go for me and the majority of the market according to the new smart phone releases
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;ash89 i want at least somewhat of a bezel so that when i‚Äôm doing something in landscape like watching a video i don‚Äôt have my hands on the fucking screen because there‚Äôs nowhere else to put them the only benefit the bezel his phone has is the fact that you can make a bigger screen without increasing the actual size but usability still suffers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mary mulligan;hate hate hate itleft samsung because of those curved more fragile screen i understand the bezeless design but hate the infinity edges
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Thomas van Engelen;ash89 i prefer a home button no round corners and no edges the bigger screen can still be done by keeping the phone larger and more battery id choose that over a smaller phone anyday
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ash89;thomas van engelen nope the trend is the way to go who wants more bezel if you can have the same features with more screen why wouldnt you want that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;thomas van engelen i personally dont i owned sharp aquos crystal back in 2015 and samsung galaxy s7 edge now and hate typing on them  but we shall see with the iphone x first iphone im actually excited about since the 4 my other daily driver is still my v20 typing on it right now and its wonderful when it is flat and tiny enough bezel for less accidental presses its bulky though the x is same dimensions as my 5 pixel but bigger screen than my v20  im sorta 5050 with this trend so far if the x is as annoying to type on like the s7e i will still keep it as a memento its the 10th anniversary iphone for goodness sakes i still have an se and want to spell out iphone sex üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;thomas van engelen i prefer dual audio over copying samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;kinan hloubi gesture controls like webos is a big deal but yeah it probably isnt worth 300 more when 8 and x share similar specs except for that oled display and emoji maker front cam im discovering that the x wont have dual front speakers while the 8 will have it and be 25 louder than the 7  i joke that im rich i wished i had lannister gold but im getting the x for the feeling of xclusiveness that i hadnt felt since owning the first iphone when not everyone owned an iphone yet ante up and get the best of the best  it may not be revolutionary or is the best phone ever made but its the best iphone ever made i dont care about the ugly camera hump on the back nobody judges beauty by the back of a persons head im a little concerned with accidental touches face id being easy to manipulate from a stranger and that notch when watching videos
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Guest4703;glasssofoj thats right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;guest4703 yep somehow a 50 price increase from the iphone eight somehow means double the price right
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;vexward palm did it before samsung with the pre matias duarte brought it back with the nexus 4 in 2012 know your smartphone history like me and michael fisher do
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;vexward thats because apples implementation is not as dodgy as samsung i am an s7 user it stutters hangs overheats i am stuck on an old version of android wish i had an iphone maybe less features but solid core software experience just sharing my personal experience dont hate me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A W;wow and i thought it was insane for canada 1529 for 256gb but of course you will need appple care and they have upped that to 250 and then there is tax so 200900 for us canadians üò°
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Factz Knight;apple is fucking raping everyones wallets
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;plebking true but at least they didn‚Äôt only make the x this year
iPhoneX;MrMobile;PlebKing;gameguy with its 750p screen and huge bezels in 2017 nah the galaxy s8oneplus 5lg v30 are much better buys imo
iPhoneX;MrMobile;PlebKing;isame 00 you can get a macbook pro for around the same price as the 128gb model
iPhoneX;MrMobile;gameguy;buy the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;you serious how much are the macbooks here in sweden 64 gb is 1100 and 256 gb 1300
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Patriotic Warrior;plebking in india it will probably cost 2100
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Liberti;twell609 yeah and android was almost 5 years behind palm adding wireless charging and some limited gesture navigation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;twell609 does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options 8 a far more efficient software  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Twell609;reza atabaki google duo for video chat they have allo to compare with imessage but imessage is better i have a google pixel xl and a iphone 7 for work my pixel is just better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Paris;well i go with apple because if he software and i have an ipad so is super easy to sync everything up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reza Atabaki;twell609 its not about the hardware give me something like imessage or facetime on android and im game but google cant make this happen remember for tech savvy people like me and you not having those apps is fine but for people that want an app like imessage that works better than every thing out there right out of the box then it creates a big problem also i had the note 7 it was the best android phone out there and i had switched from iphone 6 i can tell you that the app performance on note compared to iphone 6 was horrible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;everything but samsungs ui is smooth and optimized too its also not more reliable its actually been tested to be less stable several times than android go ahead google android more stable though ill bet 99 of you wont and will just say nuh uh again android though not samsungs forked ui important difference that doesnt work anymore as a selling point in 2017 almost everythings fast and butter smooth actually samsungs even are temporarily but they get a little slow over time due to terrible resource management and ram garbage collection being fast and smooth is the bog standard now aside from maybe 50 burner androids from 711 never used one but i dont feel too confident in defending those ones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Beastly G;androids cant be either that was 2011 where does all of this bunk ass info come from he literally mentions that in the video it used to be crappy because it was new its 675 years later now windows has been doing it for years too it works very well and in the dark thanks to infrared
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;its called ios dummy thats why apple is popular their software is so smooth and optimized
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sarcasm_;twell609 heres the thing though apple may have less features than android but it runs far more effectively so overall still a better more reliable phone and its compatible with pretty much every single app
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BrechtXT;de techie software face scanning on phones from 6 years ago yes it was shit and could be tricked dedicated face scanning like on the note7fe galaxy s8 and note 8 works great and can‚Äôt be fooled by images
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ben Ginter;yeah except android phones are awful
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rigby Car;twell609 but not as good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;tfu true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aaron Glisson;twell609 true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Owen Gee;danie johansson youre right ios is the worst part
iPhoneX;MrMobile;John H;glasssofoj its not the fact that you find the feature new its the way that people in the apple ecosystem act as though its revolutionary and innovative then apples commercials advertise it like its brand new on any phone ever thats why people point out the features are old to prevent apple getting all the credit for someone elses accomplishments
iPhoneX;MrMobile;daniel johansson;its the os dumbass
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;tmex same history like yours  20082010  iphone 2g 20102013  iphone 4  didnt buy another iphone until earlier this year with a space gray 32gb 200 se att gophone i actually dont even use it as a phone or is unlocked i just like holding it and showing off the doordash order to the cashiers so easy to hold and the design is probably the nicest among all iphones  used android back in 2011 with a nexus one fell more in love with it with the htc one m7 still the most beautiful phone design ever owned about 13 different androids first time in seven years when im actually excited for an iphone and its mainly for gesture controls and ios11 file manager and drag and drop  i will never leave android though no matter how amazing iphone x will be i have too many paid apps in the play store to ever leave it i even wear a google hat their apps like gmail gmaps youtube google voice and google photos is too important to me and those torrent apps and tubemate and swiftkey is way superior on android  google  life our online life
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;danny tanase nobody will be looking at the back of the phone all day thats such a shallow statement we do not judge beauty by the back of a persons head do we the notch bezel will get annoying though when watching videos the design is basically the essential phone but with ios
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;cesar munir thats because the iphone rejected his fuk face

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Glenn;i thought you ment iphone was always first with innovation which is never te case
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;glenn what are u talking about android is 99 always first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Glenn;karthik pullela but always a couple years to late haha
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;buy the iphone 8 k
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hollywood Scentstory;noah dejesus actually the opposite
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alifya Engineer;noah dejesus guess what else was a waste of money your mother sending you to school learn the spelling of money
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;noah dejesus lol thr fuking the costumers over there gonna buy a iphone 8 thn 3 months later come out with the iphone 10 an make people trade in the 8 an thy will double thr money while selling both phones an breaking records
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;cole byre yeah i miss webos too  sigh  favorite ui ever with the cards and swiping them up to close felt so amazing wished matias duarte implemented it more on android at least we still have nova launcher prime with some gesture swipes and double taps  thats the main reason i am getting the iphone x that and also because i plan to get the apple watch airpods and airpower headphone jack whats that eww wires
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;cole byre they have split screen and pip on ipads though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rakesh Botadkar Saiman Bobbypins;reggiehil no no ofcourse i dont mean that it seems they are thinking about the new problems that are existing and trying to tackle them differently thats all ill always be an android user üòÄ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;reggiehil;rakesh botadkar saiman bobbypins ummm dont you want to actually see it work first haha because its apple its better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;1010 original
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Team3Gaming;raypossiable exactly theyre fucking retarded to think apple copied samsung
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Acegodfather12;w j no they didnt smaller screentobody ratio lower resolution and fewer ppi apple still cant get the display right üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;8bitzawad if you didnt know the iphone x design was already leaked before the iphone 7 was even released
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;de techie ya then perfected it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImThatKid;shawn fernandes thats not why it looks like a galaxy but ok
iPhoneX;MrMobile;whoahh;samsung not doing first idiot samsung stealing from lg g6
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;ive no idea what you guys are looking at
iPhoneX;MrMobile;5TAT30FTH3ART;how is this a clone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;kickroxeatdust ppl gave essential shit because if the camera cutout and so on but it worked so will this one work out too especially since theyre saying that the iphone x will be the standard for the next 10 years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;shawn fernandes although i not a fan of how the framing of the front looks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mohamad Meshhen;angelo tarantino hhhhhaah
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;tilted by box way to try to overide somebody with dont talk what r u a kid the iphone has no chin just a camera cutout chins are used to house display drivers which apple has managed to overcome if you watched the presentation youd know that the top portion is a camera cutout and not a chin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tilted by Box;shawn fernandes u havent seen essential phone or mi mixhere the top chin is removed bottom is there but still basicly the same concept right dont talk
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;8bitzawad why would apple monkey anyone the designs been out there for a long time the front looks great theyve eliminated the chin on the bottom which the other companies havent done until now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;8bitZawad;angelo tarantino the front design looks terrible the essential phone and mi mix did complete bezelless right and the s8 and v30 got very small bezel right however the iphone looks like a horrible mix of the mi mix s8 and essential phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;De Techie;samsung got glasssandwich design concept from iphone 4  4s
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;angelo tarantino this is the second time they are doing glass design theyre not stealing anything
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;bassam alharbi id rather have the v20 for 369 new for the ir blaster and removable battery
iPhoneX;MrMobile;jacky yo;john914 mf  my father
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;miraclewarriors you‚Äôre right  phone can do more with glass on the back like doubling the chances that you‚Äôre going to shatter it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Researcher Researching Research;miraclewarriors true but you trade of a bit of durability for scratch resistance not to mention that if you drop this phone you have twice the amount of heart attack since it will be 2 sides that will breakcrack now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MiracleWarriors;aviral bajaj yep i known but many iphone users always thought that phones with glass sandwich design were a second tier stuff apple aways loved to say that the aluminum used on their products were the same used on planes and such but my point with my post was to mention that glass panel metal back panel even it it is more fragile and get smudges
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Aviral bajaj;miraclewarriors glass phones have been a thing since years
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rawaaaaaaaful;golden boy u r a mother fucker loser
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Owen Gee;golden boy you are complaining
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Golden Boy;fckin ksmzo so do you but you dont hear me complaining
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joker;fckin ksmzo it is shit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;the frozen space my dear face id didnt fail it was already recording faces at the backstage and well it isnt turning on because it wasnt craig it wasnt a clearly fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gianluccas Palhuca;the frozen space lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;the Frozen space;gianluccas palhuca new phone old feature escalating prices eh pods capabilities fail face id oh
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lean dsz;yeah  but since  it is apple n  has better developers it will become much popular than the same feature in an android phone its a bitter truth though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;lean dsz;abcdefg yea thats what
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abcdefg;charlie how much more can samsung really put into there devices tho all i can think of is dual speakers and better dac
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gianluccas Palhuca;for me  the note 8 is the best phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rafi Yagami;for apple thats innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reflex Sama;charlie  holy shit do you really have to be a smartass on commenting and correcting every single apple flamer with your copy pasting skills
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portrait lighting on the contrary what is a new feature that the note 8 has brought that weve never seen before the only thing i can think of is dual ois
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;kevin bailey but they never stated that it was their own invention
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;deyb it is whn u try to pass it off as new tech u invented
iPhoneX;MrMobile;deyb;its not about who does it first its about who does it better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;gianluccas palhuca all thy do is copy old tech an try to pass it off to the bubble customers a new
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];johnathanblade1 haha  yep thats apple for ya
iPhoneX;MrMobile;balaganesh;lebeautiful well mr mobile did say this  apple doesnt invent they perfect already existing tech ps companies should patent whore so much that apple to come to their knees to put these new techs in their phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M. Fatani;yash akkara nooo please buy the new iphone ita good for you like vitamins buuuuyyy itttttt
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;fucking hell the phone was restarted pls stop this nonsense
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Harris Armstrong;all religions are fake you be in hell  you are fake not islam
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ben Tignor;the phone had just been restarted touchid doesnt work until you enter the password once the same thing happened here
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dr.Strangefreak;i just dont want to look like im taking a selfie every time i use my phone so faceiris scanners are a no go for me but im on android i have choice
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mr Beasley;all religions are fake it failed twice n stage during the presentation soim skeptical as well it was hilarious to watch üòÇüòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;rrobertt13;fuck identical twins how does it work in the morning when you are sleepy how does it work on the beach in the sun how does it work in a carefully staged demo in ideal conditions on iphone launch oh wait we know how it did there it didnt work at all
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Masoom Rana;one hell of a lousy job these religion did roughly 2 millennia later none of their supernatural feats can be confirmed or recreated
iPhoneX;MrMobile;SuperNovaHeights;all religions are fake only android peasants will doubt face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Junior Flores;chris r source
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris R.;jesus would disagree with all religions are fakehe built the church and the gates of hell wont prevail read the church fathers ignatius polycarp and others who closely followed disciples and you will know the truth isnt something but someonejesus the christ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;all religions are fake i agree with your comment totally disagree with your user name and profile pic though
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dario Hall;i think someone should get the phone and drop 20lbs and see it if recognizes him without him using the phone for the months that it takes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Darnell‚Ñ¢;armia khairy thats actually a good question what happens if you got surgery would it still work
iPhoneX;MrMobile;All Religions are fake;indranil majumder of course everyone knows that but they were doing a live event so i assume that phone wasnt rebooted just before commencement of the event it was a legitimate face id fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Armia Khairy;will your face unlock it  after a tough fight and with a screwed face ü§î
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Indranil Majumder;face id needs passcode after restart just like android needs pattern after restart after that it works seamlessly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dilbo;charlie4christ boi if you dont get yo i believe in a nigga that couldve been saved by his father but technically was god himself the all powerful then preceded to sacrifice himself and his followers even though he couldvenot done that at all
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie4Christ;all religions are fake i hope you know that christianity is reality and not a religion remember jesus is the only way to heaven
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;use the pin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;jaycee clements  yes of course but do you not think that theyve thought of all that of course theyve thought of makeup hats hair whatever  anyways well have to see how it goes im sure well see more before the release whether or not faceid will be good or not i think that people are just overreacting
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;prayneke  how is the phone not losing its value a bad thing it just means that you can sell it later on and not lose a ton of money with most android phones they lose half their value within a year thats bad you dont want to buy a 100000 car just for its value to go down to 30000 in 5 years thats 70000 gone you want it to hold its value if not appreciate in value
iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;mayur hassija next time you go to android get a pixel im sure stock android will be as smooth as ios
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;jaycee clements does price justify the feature the answer is a no but it is worth paying it for apples great software experience having used an s7 and iphone 6s plus i can tell for sure that apples software is way ahead in refinement and stability android is yet to catch up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;prayneke;glasssofoj thats not the point you shouldnt have to pay 1000 for a phone that arguably doesnt have much new features compared to its android counterparts also android phones significantly go down in pricing over the years whereas iphones never go down below 650 which is still pretty expensive the note 8 which has features that youll probably use headphone jack sd card slot s penwill be 700 by the time the note 9 is released but the iphone x will still be a grand
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;glasssofoj true and i have to agree with you on that although 300 is a substantial increase in the price from the base model anyone who can afford a 700 phone may have the budget to buy a 1000 phone but the point of conversation is do you think the increase in price justifies the features it has and how future proof is the feature imagine varying changes in conditions day to day life etc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;mayur hassija plastic surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars the iphone xis only 300 bucks more than the base model 8 but people act like that extra 300 is the most extremely ungodly increase of the price of any device in history  i mean if you can afford to pay 700 dollars for a phone i‚Äôm pretty damn sure you can pay 1000 and if you can‚Äôt you probably shouldn‚Äôt be buying the 700 phone in the first place either
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ryspadda;skyartlerist d u can use any finger tho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;skyartlerist d if youre investing 1k into a device u best believe its features are going to be flawless and worth your money right now i can imagine more flaws than proper implementation i believe buying a premium device blindly just for pure hype without accounting unforeseen circumstancesnuisances is more stupid imho
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;jaycee clements  sure you might not be able to even see if your face is disfigured enough cant use your phone then point is the whole what if your face explodes and you cant unlock your phone argument is just stupid imho there will always be whatifs
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;jaycee clements wow never thought of tht
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;kingslayer agreed its a cool concept but execution wise its a fail what if i wear glasses do i have to remove my glasses each time i unlock imagine getting muggedsnatched when youre temporarily blind how about unlocking the device when youre driving and you have your glasses on reverting back to good old pin code password each time just makes it seem like a total waste of investment
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jaycee clements this x wont play nice to arya stark folks wanting to make a sex change like bruce jenner and people who love to wear costumes during comiccon and halloween
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jaycee clements luckily it is being released after halloween imagine wearing a darth vader kylo ren or iron man mask and needing to take it off every single time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;skyartlerist d then you probably wouldnt be using a cellphonehandphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;what if you get in a terrible accident and your fingers get cut off hmmmmmmmmm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;mayur hassija true but no plastic surgery can ever replace your original facial features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jaycee Clements;ajay patil then the face unlock feature in the iphone x is rather flawed then
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mayur Hassija;jaycee clements if you can afford an iphone 10 you can afford a plastic surgery too üòÇ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Usama Shoukat;placing touch id on backüòõüòõüòõüòõüòõ
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;but then they wouldnt have that 85 screen if you want touch id take the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;wj does samsungandroid have 1 3d face scanning  20x more secure than touch id 2 ar so advanced 3 4k  60fps 3 1080p  240fps 4 85 screen to body ratio 5 facial depth tracking 6 portrait mode front and back 7 studio lighting options  no so take your ignorant trap back to canada thanks logic
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W J;mdabul hossain only took 4 years and a whole slew of android software and hardware features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Freshly Squeezed;kevin bailey personally i think its the ugliest iphone design tbh that camera hump doesnt do it justice nor does the top bezel right in the middle
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;freshly squeezed best design yet tho i cant lie
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;freshly squeezed ive used them all and can be platform agnostic if i wanted to be they all can get boring actually i am more excited with ios11 than the hardware features from the x i think ios11 might be a bigger update than oreo im on oreo now with my pixel and i hardly see much changes android has moved pretty slowly too since transitioning from kit kat to lollipops material design
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];ill definitely spend some time with the 8 as well yes
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ihsan Husandi;split screen multitasking literally sucks on a phone honestly it only useful for tablet and as far as i love android ipad does way better job on split screen multitasking than the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DJ GMONEY;yash akkara but you can only have 1 opened on the screen at the same time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;it can run about 50 apps in the background which is huge samsung lags after 30ish
iPhoneX;MrMobile;glasssOfOJ;i can‚Äôt remember if anyone on stage during the keynote actually said multitasking but even if they did isn‚Äôt the official term that apple calls it actually the app switcher because that‚Äôs really all it is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;kevin bailey;mrmobile michael fisher thy will copy tht soon to an act like thy invented it thr bubble users will belive them an b so enthused and fascinated
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;mrmobile michael fisher  i just find it odd that apple puts the pip feature on ipads but not on iphones probably to diffentiate and throw a bone to their tablets for people to keep buying them  btw pip on oreo still feels like beta i ended up using gplayer paid one wo ads just so i can play a video while watching youtube at the same time i used to use mobo player for years but it seems to be a chinese rogue app with wakelocks my favorite video player apps are mx player pro and gplayer  thats whats missing with iphones for me torrent apps like flud to download my game of thrones and the walking dead episodes and video miniplayer on the home screen google photos is a lifesaver for storage and photovideo album
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KevinIsSoAwsome;mrmobile michael fisher wish it had split screen multitasking but that would just be the cherry on top
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];multitasking is just running more than one app at the same time even if one of them is running in the background splitscreen multitasking is what youre referring to i think and no doesnt look like the x has that feature though it probably has the horsepower
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;lance tech good b8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Salis Salman;mrmobile michael fisher indeed apple has proven they can remove anything of of their products for the sake of innovation or maybe just for shock value and press coverage headphone jack regular usb ports on macbooks now touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];right yeah im really  i continue to be surprised that apple ditched touchid on this thing faceid better be rocksolid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;ssdada urdsada well u have one bezeless or one with bezels thats choice and the nub looks alright they wanted to eliminate chins but u have to put the sensors somewhere
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ssdada urdsada;they removed bezels coulda fooled me iphone 8 still has large ass bezels and the ipone x has that ugly ass nub bezel
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Shawn Fernandes;teebakes u have choices
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ed lonzy;mrmobile michael fisher haha my surface book has been really good
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];depends on the device for me my surface laptop is amazing at hello but my surface pro doesnt know me from a dude in a big bird suit
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sachankara;qnx is just a core like the linux kernel blackberry 10 was blackberrys own qt based gesture controlled os which worked on top of qnx
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jason Zimmerman;swipe up for home  ah just like my beloved windows phone  so much potential  we hardly knew ye
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;abhinandan darbey  palm webos did it first blackberry bought qnx and then rebranded it as bb10  im surprised matias duarte who helped create palms webos didnt do it for android since he has been with google back in 2011  swiping up to close apps feels so natural over pressing home or recent apps all the time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kenneth Daniels;mrmobile michael fisher webos touchstone  gestures i wanna cry   paaaaalm
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ATW Tech - Alpha R2;abhinandan darbey so iphone x is infinitely better youre right there buddy
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];this  i mean  i mean yeah kinda
iPhoneX;MrMobile;BalthazarTheGreat;qualcomm has the tech and the first phones to use it will be some vivo device q1 of 2018  it‚Äôs a special piezoelectric chip that sends waves through the oled panel then bounces it off the underside of the cover glass where your finger rests and can detect microscopic differences from the ridges on your finger print pretty bizarre how it works really but they claim it‚Äôs just as effective and secure as physical fingerprint scanners
iPhoneX;MrMobile;It's Akile;i heard it being challenging with oled
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krishna Adettiwar;patstar5 it senses depth look at the videos on how you set up face id you dont need to hold the phone up to your face it can tell its your face from all angles its very unlike any other facial recognition done on any other phone bc its using new sensors never seen before and has a dedicated neural engine that runs on a custom chip that helps unlock your phone based on a neural network they created of millions of faces although we need to wait to see how well it functions its apparently far more secure than touch id or the fingerprint sensors on other phones and its in another league compared to facial recognition and iris scanning on other phones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;cmer;they were successful in using the technology but were unable to mass produce it in an efficient manner hopefully thatll get worked out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;isame 00;patstar5 they wouldnt as theyve already left that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;M I C H;patstar5 samsung will they work together with the company who does this i think samsung owns that company im not sure
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie so they say well see in demo the guy got troubles with opening the with his face doesnt look good fingerprint way faster and better
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;krystal myth you cant use a 3d printed mask to fool faceid they stated this in the keynote skin has a special spectral signature which absorbs or disperses ir wavelengths  so people that think they can defeat the next iphone using a photograph or 3d printed mask will be disappointed faceid has 30000 data points which are analysed compared to 400 for the s8s and note 8s iris scanner touch id under the display simply wasnt viable as it is incredibly hard to mass produce the new technology
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;you want them to push weaker techology to curb embarrassment this really is a narcissists age aduts are capable of admitting mistakes they can push face id and still have the integrity to put proper fingerprint technology on their phones some banks will not accept anything less than a fingerprint for identification and this is for a reason for one thing you cant use a dead mans fingerprint on a fingerprint sensor you can use a 3d printed face to fool face id dead or alive your face will work with face id its a poor replacement you dont want them being too proud here to be unable to admit it simply had to wait for touch id to be ready
iPhoneX;MrMobile;le mec Miranda;i read samsung is currently working on puting the fingerprint reader under the screens of their upcoming s9s they were trying to do it with the note 8 but couldnt mass produce it yet so they left it for the s9
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel Chattergoon;idk even if apple figures out how to implement the fingerprint scanner under the display apple might not do it because it would be embarrassing for them if they did especially since they spoke really highly about their facial recognition  i personally think that apple should forget about touch id and focus more of their time resources and money on improving face id instead of trying to split their efforts on touch id and face id i could see face id failing in situations where someone grabs the phone and points it at the owners face to unlock it so thats something apple will need to work on and solve if they havent done so already  as much as i prefer having a fingerprint scanner instead of face recognition whats done is done no going back now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;patstar5 the technology is there theres a company that already made working demos some months ago but i dont know if they made a final product at all they will probably implement touch id back when they have the technology apple was pushed to release a phone that was not  behind on every aspect to an android phone minus the chip and the fluidity of the os
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justin Beast;patstar5 id hope all manufacturers who can give us this technology use both but idk maybe these companies will be stingy and give us only one its hard to tell really
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;justin beast thats what im talking about when apple reveals the new iphones this time next year will they utilize this technology or just use facial recognition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Justin Beast;patstar5 he means we may see it on later phones you cant add a fingerprint sensor under the display on a phone thats already released lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;patstar5;vegito blue so will apple add it later on then how would they explain that off
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vegito Blue;patstar5 both tried but couldnt get it in time its not that they couldnt do it at all they just couldnt fit the date
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];its toward the end 999 expensive af
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;hurileno lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hurileno;which dosent have a physical button
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;eurokers digital life hell ill even take a 3d touch home button but thats not even an option i guess ill stick with my note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Matthew Fernandez;eurokers digital life preach
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Varga;except maybe the live keynote itself
iPhoneX;MrMobile;FallingTitan;watching more then 1 vid is a waste of your time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Addy M;kid kaos and thats why we all flock over to his videos when a new phone is revealed üòé
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];glad to hear it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Gaber Jr.;people were handling the device for stage demo ahead of time says a rep and didnt realize face id was trying to authenticate their face after failing a number of times because they werent craig the iphone did what it was designed to do which was to require his passcode in other words face id worked as it was designed to
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;stig name you are a idiot the phone is going to sell regardless of a human error he used it after that and it work flawlessly every time my guess is he grabbed the wrong phone first then he switched to the other one and it worked every time
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;benjamin woods dont give me that crap it failed once and gave the message it obviously just restarted
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joshua Sandoval;it wasnt a fail the iphone said that a password was required for face id to function pay attention
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;even if it wasnt due to it not detecting his face properly of which there is compelling evidence it didnt detect it twice it was a slick ish presentation where that sort of things should not be happening as it leads to discussions like this and was therefore a fail
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Robert Lamoa;dhirendra sahay for real
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lukez;alright then i was wrong thank you for your information but i think they had multiple devices there to show different things like the presentation of the iphone 2g i think it was the wrong one to show faceid maybe there was a different face registered but yeah your right it failed but still i think when it is released it will work great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fede D.Z;its his job otherwise he wouldnt be there would he if he is not capable of doing that why he insists in being at the stage if he cant handle things properly dont defend the undefendable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sam M.;stop with this freshly booted nonsense that is not what the phone said it said your passcode is required to use face id which is the exact same message you get for touch id if you use the wrong finger several times the message after a boot is touchface id requires your passcode when iphone restarts  screenshot from presentation httpsiimgurcom9l47rjwpng photo of the boot message httpsiimgurcomueogrt4jpg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lukez;no faceid did not fail i watched the presentation the phone was freshly booted it said your iphone needs your passcode after the boot after that it worked flawlessly
iPhoneX;MrMobile;African Pastor;dhirendra sahay yop yall see it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel the Omnipotent;the fact that the amount of people joining the fail during conference bandwagon truly amazes me he did not fail its required to enter a password before you can use touchid and same thing for the new faceid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;jamal blakk believe me michael fisher is one of those rare reviewer who does every review honestly and never afraid to hit apple on their face  so be patient for mrmibiles full review
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jamal Blakk;yeah i noticed dude took a swipe at samsungs facial recognition in this video but he failed to mention apples demo of facial recognition failed on stage sup with that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Apple User 5151;david hunsinger dude mistakes happen and thats what humans do why are you creating an issue about this  man i am really pissed now you forgot what happen to samsung with the note 7 that was too a mistake l
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Apple User 5151;shawn mcdermott yes i saw it again and it showed face id requires your passcode and in the hands on video the apple executives showed the face id feature and it worked better than touch id and flawlessly these people are meant to do comments like these
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ya00007;mrmobile michael fisher you know how to rub people up the wrong way dont you btw why are your reviews so rubbish i keep falling asleep
iPhoneX;MrMobile;–°–∞–∏–± –ì–∞—Å–∞–Ω–æ–≤;mrmobile michael fisher way to go being an asshole to your commenters
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Mia Tufail;mrmobile michael fisher i see today you are not the unbiased facts presenting reviewer i used to know you for
iPhoneX;MrMobile;EU hot dog;samuel chattergoon i would not date the girl if she was black
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chidiebere Nwaekpe;and apple isn‚Äôt bother is you decide not to buy one i hate how people just hate a company that make good products
iPhoneX;MrMobile;LIKWID;jayy cole ah and here we have it folks your every day apple hater no reasons why they just like to hate gg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Hasanshi sado;jayy cole i have the 7splus im telling you this iphone 10 is not what its made out to seem
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel Chattergoon;jayy cole you didnt even give a good reason for not buying the phone just because its apple was your reason thats like saying that you wont date a black girl because shes a black girl
iPhoneX;MrMobile;*skyartlerist* *D*;wow youre so cool wow i wanna be a hipster cool guy like you when i grow up you dislike a product because its popular wow so cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jos√© Junior;kingslayer im not a fan either but this phone is just amazing expensive as fck but amazing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;jos√© junior michael isnt even an iphoneios fan just like me but he recognizes great potential when he sees it hes the best tech reviewer period the best to ever do it sorry marques jon4lakers and so many others they just dont have the presentation charming sense of humor and voice like mr mobile does
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Atulya Aman;daniele maglaque its 2436 x 1125 you look it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniele Maglaque;iphone x is 2k panel look it up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;diegifier i would actually get the v30 if i didnt have last years lg flagships already  i love lg they arent perfect and there are some questionable quality control issues but among the best and most reliable brands out there i have mostly good things to say with every lg product i owned i tried like 14 or 15 different phone brands lg is up there with nokia and moto for me lg is underrated and quietly innovative which is what i used to think htc was  youre gonna love that wideangle cam plan to bring my v20 to rome next april v30 no longer has removable battery and ir blaster but it is still a winner and over 300 cheaper than iphone x they will get discounted under 500 within two months low risk high reward brand

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yongki Siaw;just chillin no just face id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sajid Ahsan;just chillin there is no fingerprint sensor
iPhoneX;MrMobile;just chillin;reece webb isnt that a major problem then like so many times my phone is lying on the table and i just use the fingerprint to see any messages however with this i have to keep my face leveled
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reece Webb;just chillin no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spooka Doota;when portrait lighting fails on the actual conference its not an actual feature neural engines on a closed os is not very useful the note 8 is capable of it but is not updated yet shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Lee Squires;researcher researching research typical android nut spouting the same crap every time an iphone is released obviously jealousthreatened well done
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;researcher researching research one could say the same about samsung at least apple didnt publish a 132 page internal doc explicitly stating they need to copy another company and i currently own 3 notes and an s8 plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable so why are you expecting iphones feature on android
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 this is iphone not a samsung phone even some other android phones dont have half of the features you mentioned
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;charlie you can continue but do iphone has spen do apple has 960fps slo mo do apple has quad hd or 4k displaydo apple has dual pixel auto focus do apple has a proper file management system do iphone has heartrate monitor do iphone has blood oxygen monitordo iphone has always on display do iphone has iris scanner do iphone x has fingerprint reader do iphone x has 35mm headphone jack do iphone has fast charging shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ace Morales;raypossiable yea i guess so lmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;ace morales apparently people dont seem to watch this video with volume on
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ace Morales;researcher researching research the first thing this guy says is apple tries to do things better not first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ImThatKid;hunkasaurus rex  lol stop you really should do research
iPhoneX;MrMobile;whoahh;i dont think this weaboo has galaxy s8 u dream it child
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;why does it matter that they skipped a number  samsung did it to get their two flagship devices of the same generation under similar branding using the same number  apple used x because in latin x is ten and its been ten years since the first iphone  x also carries the notion of experimentation which is what apple are claiming the iphone x is
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Enigmazflo;antione english bro its not about opening apps but its about consistency in terms of battery life app performance and value for money look i am not trying to say that android is bad and stuff what apple has done with a11 for ar is amazing and dont forget the  face idcome on mate all i see these days is that people fighting  over who is better and not the hardwork put in by each manufacturers
iPhoneX;MrMobile;antione english;enigmazflo if you are happy that you can open apps quicker congratulations but what else
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Enigmazflo;researcher researching research dude iphones cpu destroys the current best line up available form android side
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie please do you need those to what 4k 240fps you eyes dont even see the difference to bit lower fps oooh4k sony did 4k shit way before apple they allready have 4k screen on phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raou TV;charlie please do cause it is also the first phone who copied shit ton from android world yet it still fails to deliver all the goods for its price lets be realistic i can get a phone that costs less than half and i can have better camera better display better audio and video meaning i will have both manually which apple seems to fail to deliver not to mention better battery life and a feature that iphone will never have a wide angle camera or an rgbmonocrome so i would either go huawei or lg
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A Snell;charlie as for the camera thats why i paid good money for my canon and my computer if im that picky about videos and pictures as far as talking animal emojis thats for kids to use in my opinion and for women that like cute things to do as for ar gaming i dont play games on my phone period whether it was my iphones or androids and i cant just sit anywhere thats important and start playing an ar game picture lighting and changing how look is almost like catfishing to me lol if you feel your looks arent up to par then hey you can jazz yourself up then lastly i would have fingerprint scanning over face id any day on any phone  its not faster for one 2 not even twins have the same fingerprints and if you want to get really picky there is nothing 100 percent full proof out of any device  whether by genius force or hardwaresoftware failure someone can get in it im tired of gimick stuff from all phones i want to see more businessadult improvements for everyday using especially for spending thousands on a phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;well the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portait lighting shall i continue
iPhoneX;MrMobile;friendly911 OS;they dont they just know that people would buy it even if it was 10000
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;because theyre a company and companies want to make as much money as they can thats pretty much the main reason if you think about it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dany Rockwell;shareholders
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;because they can until they lost customers loyalty they still milking them with the high price tag
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Applelover800;flyingdutchdude5 there was a story that said that apple will be depending way less on samsung for oled screens and also trying to make their own and also the price will get cheaper and also please stay with apple because the integration
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 because of apple needing to buy parts like oled displays the price increase because the parts theyre buying are expensive because of those expensive parts apple needs to make profits by selling it at a higher price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable may becan you explain
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;avinashrai11141 you still dont get my point do you
iPhoneX;MrMobile;eli;im sorry does iphone x have a stylus with a 4096 levels pressure sensitive screen mm no im just gonna wait for my red hydrogen to actually fucking innovate
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;avinashrai11141 thats not completely true the market is responsible for that price point if the market can bare to pay that price then apple will continue setting that price pricing a product isnt simply deciding on a price for getting the highest return the market shares blame in that
iPhoneX;MrMobile;avinashrai11141;raypossiable apple is reponsible for price of iphones or macbooks because apple has highest profit margin
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RayPosSiable;because they buy parts from their own competing companies especially samsung who you should blame for the price of the iphone x
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Eckersen;but there is a point of diminishing returns where the cost is prohibitively more expensive than the performance you are getting thus making it a bad deal
iPhoneX;MrMobile;flames 8889;10secondsrule because ive been a tech pm in telecom for the last 18 years and do all my work on mobile outside of that i am a phone enthusiast  the fact that it may be stupid to you doesnt make it stupid so no its not stupid again anyone who can afford to buy whatever theyd like and finds utility in it is not stupid
iPhoneX;MrMobile;10secondsrule;flames 8889 well it is stupid you just don‚Äôt realise it rather than pointing out grammar mistakes to somebody who probably is not using english as a mother tongue please do tell us why do you need all these flagship phones again
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Chris Eckersen;of course they do

iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];preach
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jedd Simon;yash akkara apple actually acknowledged the failed attempt they said due to a lot of people handling and setting up the iphone for the presentation the iphone was scanning everyones faces
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;fucking hell im so done the phone restarted it showed it on the screen pls end this nonsense
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;fastlikeuno the other two new  iphones have the touch id  im going for the 8 plus
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jedd Simon;fastlikeuno a lot will miss the touch id
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Trapezoid;if i am not mistaken the error was because of the phone being reset so it required a numeric passcode
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];if youre talking about the demo id say wait until the thing is out in the real world if it sucks in real life you can bet ill tell you it sucks  but judging a product by a live demo two months before launch isnt cool

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;roy reno  iphone xclusive  separates the rich from the poor ante up kid or work harder to get it apple has always been about being a premium luxury brand they sell an apple watch for 10000 with a certain band apple sells laptop and desktop computers for 30005000 samsung sells a tv for 100000  1000 with the way inflation will go up is not so much to ask you dont enter a mercedesbenz dealership and expect affordable prices comparable to a kia you dont fly firstclass or stay in a 5star hotel for cheap ante up  im rich i can afford pissing away a grand for a smartphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Roy Reno;jorge munoz iphone xpensive
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reino Yu;krystal myth lol you have background on this clearly you didnt its not just your facial dumbass its your 3d facial structure your facial structure has unique identifiers just like your finger prints do even more the 3d sensors do not interpret your face like how our naked eyes do it maps your face based on the unique points on your facial structure all these unique points have specific distance space contours and exact locations which are analysed and computed by their fast processor thats why it will not be fooled by even by twins there are small possibilities coz even theyre similar to their dna level yet as they grow up their body experience and responds to their external environment differently and so their body and facial structure cant be 100 similar if scanned into details it also works under low light as it uses infrared wave and even with makeup if you ever do your master degree i bet youd fail coz how you do your research is so poor just search 3d face recognition vs fingerprint recognition
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;sio wat yeah there would probably be too much radiation that we would be exposed to
iPhoneX;MrMobile;sio wat;wifi and bluetooth are low power radio signals to charge over the air would require high power rays waves it would not be safe also the existing technology uses magnetic fields luckily they only act over short distances or they would blow electronic equipment air charge will never happen qi or some variant is all
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kalpesh Patel;dont give apple ideas p
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;krystal myth finally someone here who actually gets it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;kalpesh patel and why not also remove the screen so apple can claim that it has stellar battery life than any other phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Daniel Namelast;courageüòê
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raveen Bikha;jonaq niveer sarma well if someone figures true wireless out
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kalpesh Patel;its possible actually connectors right on the surface can do the trick wireless charging is already here i was xpecting iphone x to do so remove ports remove buttons etc
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;it is not more secure ive background on this you dont need the kind of clearances ive had to know face recognition is hardly more secure than a fingerprint dude a fingerprint is a unique identifier that requires the owner be alive to even function facial recognition has no such conductive requirement a model of your face would be enough dont kid yourself here just to justify  a buy this is a reduction in security bar none no self respective security agency that uses fingerprint biometrics would ever see facial recognition as a replacement iris plus fingerprint sure face plus fingerprint yes iris and voice maybe facial alone fuck no
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Xue Ern Neo;doge‚Ñ¢ face id can reportedly work in the dark i think
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;reino yu regardless of whether or not its more secure facial recognition in general is still not as practical than a fingerprint reader for example when you need to unlock the phone during the night you have to turn the light on having a fingerprint reader also means that you can easily just directly unlock the phone without taking it out of your pocket
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Thanh Tran;jonaq niveer sarma kaching
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Reino Yu;they removed fingerprint scanner coz they can introduce better technology which is 3d facial recognition its more secure than 2d fingerprint read the research not by apple they can remove the charging port if they can finally introduce wireless charging technology without using any pad which can charge over a long distance range why not for any data transfer to computer it can be done by wifi wlan its all about introducing new better working technology rather than sticking with the old one change can be good i wonder why people are complaining when it is working
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;jonaq niveer sarma i swear if you get this right imma give you my car
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Moviefan137;iphone x no home button  iphone xi no charging port  iphone xii no display  iphone xiii no battery  iphone xiv an empty box  iphone xv no box it will only exist in augmented reality ar
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DOGE‚Ñ¢;apple in 2018 in our new iphone 11 we took tremendous amounts of courage to remove the charging port such innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W. L.;tokekkk iphone x1
iPhoneX;MrMobile;A W;jackelofnar i agree 100 its ridiculous how much phones are  i have a feeling it will only get worse
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Miguel;jackelofnar that and fast charging cost 85 for a built in feature
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Joe S;this is the premium model you dont have to get it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alex Willis;exquisite diamonds
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Bob Jones;jackelofnar it is a premium product from a premium company you dont see people complaining about how expensive rolex watches are
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;strpl2 actually after best buys 150 reduction and trade in with verizoni have an old lg g4 which values at 240  combined thats almost 400 off the samsung bringing it to 590 sorry no comparison
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Eddie R;miguel angel medina rise note 8 is 960 dollars lol dont bash apple when other companies are doing it first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;strpl2;jackelofnar  so is 960 for the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ECDT1089;as a current iphone 7 user paying 1000 for a phone is ridiculous i wont be upgrading

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Doge The Dog;1000 phone better comes with all the possible bands unlocked bootloader and straight out the box root access and a failsafe if anything breaks also a community that would create custom roms for 67 years at least im talking only about android sorry

iPhoneX;MrMobile;Diego Martinez;food republic how much porn are you downloading that 64 gigs is nowhere enough  ive had my 64 gig phone almost 2 years have 1000s of photos and videos hundreds of apps and i still have 20 gigs left
iPhoneX;MrMobile;starwars551;then dont buy it there are dozens of great phones that are under half that price
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DJens;jackelofnar but still it get a lot sales
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Nyarukosan787;novak bullshit it doesnt even get android 5 lollipop
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Novak;nyarukosan787 xiaomi first gen mi 1 gets updates right till this day
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ajay raj;admiral ashik ummm what processorall day to day applications which youll use are much more fluid on some phones with 835 than apple eg one plus 5 or htcand whats the point of a so called bionic to make apple fans wet just like that if you cant use it in real life applications for which you use a phone forpeople forget that in the end you are using a mobile only
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Randy Fleet;yea because of the payment plans
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Evan Williams;you can change the screen to qhd on the note 8 so you would be incorrect also samsung just announced 4k at 60fps on the note 8 its coming in an update
iPhoneX;MrMobile;King Of Kings;charlie the note 8 just got an update to  4k at 60fps i guess it didnt take long ha so did they reach that level yet how long will it take for apple to catch up to qualcomm level of 960fpslmao
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;d tech terminal don‚Äôt overwork your already much inferior processor to reduce it‚Äôs already limited lifespan
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;admiral ashik buddy im an official developer of resurrection remix and ive made some custom kernels too so i know what im saying if you dont believe just read the link i posted above s8 got a mod to enable 60fps 4k video recording and i knew its possible because i had zuk z1 which didnt came with 1080p 60fps support but we made it possible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;d tech terminal 4k 60fps support by software will google also add water resistance and stereo speaker by software update man you are retarded
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;dark007 look what i said is true httpwwwfirstpostcomtechnewsanalysissamsunggalaxys8cameramodbrings1440p60fpsvideorecordingamongothergoodies3988929html
iPhoneX;MrMobile;abcdefg;magnus vantrum theres actually many more improvements you have to use one to understandi used one yesterday and very impressed but still waiting to see the v30 and pixel 2 lol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;mar m;iphone sucks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;King Of Kings;charlie when can the a11 do 960fpslol
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;charlie okay thats great but do you know google hired a chip engineer to manufacture their own soc and google is even in talks with htc to acquire their cellphone business so in future google wont be a software company which develops android for the phones of other brands theyll have their own hardware and software so things are going to be great
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;d tech terminal not a big deal 4k 60fps shows the shear power of the a11 bionic i wonder how long it will take for qualcomm to reach the level apple is at currently fun fact the low cpu core on the a11 bionic is equivalent to the power of one of the high cores in the qualcomm 835
iPhoneX;MrMobile;D Tech Terminal;dark007  do you know that google added hdr support on pixel and pixel xl just with software its not a very big deal to add 4k 6pfps support by software the main bottleneck will be the overheating i guess otherwise its completely possible
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;dark007 yeah but not everyone is an amateur film maker
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;d tech terminal improved its way faster and the camera can do 4k at 60 fps the cheapest camera that can do that costs 2k
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Admiral Ashik;harrry hrld infinity display that they ship with 1080p default while iphone x has true tone display and qhd making it better display by farit also has portrait on both camera has 4k 60fps 1080p 240 fps neural engine ar capabilities and these are not in note 8 which is only 70 cheaper and iphone also has much better soc by far
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;sachankara in android you need to mod it using xposed edge if there is alot of demand i am sure google will implement it in the next version just like many android improvement that bassically coming from android modding community first
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dezta93;wait until apple ditching the usb port on the iphone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Yash Akkara;dude youre not gonna buy it anyway youre just a hater and if youre so concerned buy the iphone 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Sachankara;nokia n9 and blackberry 10 did it alright too it just goes so much faster and smoother to multitask using swipe gestures i had some slight hope for sailfish os and ubuntu touch but i guess the ios will be the first really popular os to embrace it  android will probably not get swipe gestures in the same way its just too limited due to its back button requirement but one can always hope they solve it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tams80;theres no reason they couldnt have bad both  some of the other gestures look painful to do as well
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;kingslayer as an audio lover wireless sucks and i have good wireless ear buds jaybird x3s whoop apples ear ods in terms of sound quality and even though they cost 130 bucks they pale in comparison to the wired single driver shure in ear monitors on amazon for 50 bucks
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Blay Blhompson;stanley johnson worse
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Krystal Myth;disagree you guys still dont get the value of the headphone jack if you think a home button is as universally modular useful and accessible as a 35mm jack
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Fawad Bilgrami;its a good idea blackberry did it pretty well with their gestures
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;stanley johnson  do you play for the detroit pistons my brother played against you back in the day  michael fisher is correct as usual he likes things that i like shit i even like star wars and star trek i miss webos swipe to close apps too so naturally satisfying  kid future is going to be wireless just get the airpods and airpower to benefit from it for the playstation 5 are fans asking for wired controllers again move on  üï∏ dont let life get tangled up
iPhoneX;MrMobile;ME BL;nah gestures are cool
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Luke LaFleur;stanley johnson the gestures sort of remind me of the amazon fire phone
iPhoneX;MrMobile;MrMobile [Michael Fisher];strongly disagree this might be my favorite feature from an interface perspective got so used to flickinguptohome in my palm pre days i loved it
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Spirus Visuals;well theyre working on fullroom wireless charging so you wont need a pad at all but can just walk into a room and have your devices start charging that way you can use them while they charge and still have no ports
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Ciabo69;kingslayer the only difference is that all those controllers come with the purchase buying good wireless headphones is at least 100 dollars and that charging pad is probably going to be around 150 so if u want a device with a charger and a pair of headphones to be well over 1300 then yeah fantastic idea the rest of us will stick with cables  and btw u charge all those remotes with guess what a cable
iPhoneX;MrMobile;youssef fetouh;well we all know that wireless is the future
iPhoneX;MrMobile;DeAnna Hundley;jony ive said his perfect iphone would be a sheet of glass so i can honestly see them removing the charging port in a few generations
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kingslayer;flandersned good  üï∏  i dont see people asking for wired controllers again on the next playstation or xbox get iphone x apple watch airpods and airpower  charge them all done
iPhoneX;MrMobile;W. L.;and then after 1 or 2 years in dongle hell apple will invent a phone with all the useful ports and features build in innovation
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Rick Cs;alden mor yeah and you wont be able to pick it up whike charging  it will be a bad thing and my friend jackless iphone is inconvenient since many times they cant connect to an aux cord or none bluetooth headphones
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vegito Blue;flandersned i just feel like sense apple did it they can get away with it but my s8 still stands true
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alden Mor;flandersned it won‚Äôt be a bad thing looks how many phones aren‚Äôt using headphone jacks now
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Alden Mor;kiran addala yes it is first in the industry for 3d facial  you‚Äôre thinking of fav oak recognition it‚Äôs not the same thing
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Raveen Bikha;simon does it have handoff and continuity
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Simon;at least the note 8 is an excellent phone with highend features
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Emad Ahmed;charlie true but its still the baddest beast on the market unlike the iphone x which is just a competitor to its younger sibling the galaxy s8 not even the s8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Tommi;charlie neither was iphone7
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;neither was the note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Terty Brown;charlie well im not defending samsung but if you didnt already knowthe s8s cpu can as init actually can shoot video in 4k  120fps but its just samsung didnt let the full performance of the s8 shine in the camera department you can check out websites about that anywayswhy the hell did samsung not allow the full performance of the phone to shine is franklymind blowing imhodisabling this performance is soo stupid and ignorant of themwill samsung actually release a software update that lifts this restriction well never know but anyways the point isif it could shoot 4k slo mo  120fpsimagine the fps captured in 1080p itll probably be 480fps just saying from my theory sinceif the iphone could shoot 4k  60fps and 1080p slo mo  240fps though id like to see the competition respond to this for a more competitive marketoh and i was talking about the exynos model of the s8 not the snapdragon
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Vedant Goel;khotta bogard kaguraaaaa
iPhoneX;MrMobile;RiceCube Tech;charlie those features are really cool no doubt but definitely not worth the price and if youre gonna be shooting those kind of frame rates you need more than 64 gb s of storage which th e iphone x will only have 256 for a much higher price tag so in the end youre paying like hundreds of dollars for doubling the frame rates at those two resolutions
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Charlie;slight diference the iphone x is the first phone that is capable of recording 4k 60fps 1080p 240fps it is the first phone to have a dedicated neural engine front facing portrait mode portrait lighting on the contrary what is a new feature that the note 8 has brought that weve never seen before the only thing i can think of is dual ois
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Kagura Schimizu;for instance almost all of its feature is on android like gesture i mean that feature is on almost any android and android has on screen finger print scanner like vivo phone haha peace
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Jenison;more expensive with slight differencehow about the shitty note 8
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;dark007 but ill reply fight me
iPhoneX;MrMobile;KickRoxEatDust;khotta bogard cause we want more customization
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Dark007 -;khotta bogard he wont reply cause he just hates on apple has nothing better 2 do in life
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Khotta Bogard;kagura schimizu describe why its only a slight difference
iPhoneX;MrMobile;Samuel James;dipendra poudel i believe the 8plus is ip68
